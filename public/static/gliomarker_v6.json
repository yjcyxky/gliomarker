    "abstract": "Background. Glioma is one of the most aggressive and lethal human brain tumors. Accumulating evidence shows that microRNAs play important roles in cancers, including glioma. Previous studies reported that miR-124 levels were downregulated in glioma specimens. Here, we further investigate the potential role of miR-124 in glioma. Methods. The expression levels of miR-124 were detected in glioma specimens by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The direct targets of miR-124 were identified by bioinformatics analysis and were further validated by immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assay. The effects of miR-124 on glioma cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to temozolomide were analyzed by Cell-Counting Kit 8 assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis. A xenograft model was used to study the effect of miR-124 on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Results. Expression levels of miR-124 were greatly downregulated in glioma specimens. related Ras viral oncogene homolog (R-Ras) and neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (N-Ras) were identified as direct targets of miR-124. MiR-124 inhibited glioma cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth and increased chemosensitivity to temozolomide treatment by negatively regulating the Ras family and its downstream signaling pathways: phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt and Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, overexpression of R-Ras rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-124. Meanwhile, overexpression of R-Ras and N-Ras restored miR-124-inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription activation. In clinical glioma specimens, protein levels of R-Ras and N-Ras were upregulated and inversely correlated with miR-124 expression levels. Conclusions. Taken together, these results revealed that miR-124 levels in tumor tissues are associated with glioma occurrence, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance and that miR-124 may be used as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma in the future.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas in the form of astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas  and glioblastomas are the most common brain tumors in humans.  Early detection of these cancers is crucial for successful treat ment. Proteomics promises the discovery of biomarkers and tumor  markers for early detection and diagnosis. In the current study, a  differential gel electrophoresis technology coupled with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy was used to investigate  tumor-specific changes in the proteome of human brain cancer. Fifty  human brain tissues comprising varying diagnostic groups (non tumor, grade I, grade II, grade III and grade IV) were run in duplicate  together with an internal pool sample on each gel. The proteins of  interest were automatically picked, in-gel digested and mass  spectrometry fingerprinted. Two hundred and eleven protein spots  were identified successfully and were collapsed into 91 unique  proteins. Approximately 20 of those 91 unique proteins had, to our  knowledge, not been reported previously as differentially expressed  in human brain cancer. Alb protein, peroxiredoxin 4 and SH3  domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein 3 were upregulated  in glioblastoma multiform versus non-tumor tissues. However,  aldolase C fructose-biphosphate, creatine kinase, B chain dihydrolipoyl  dehydrogenase, enolase 2, fumarate hydratase, HSP60, lactoyl glutathione lyase, lucine aminopeptidase, Mu-crystallin homolog,  NADH-UO 24, neurofilament triplet L protein, septin 2, stathmin  and vacuolar ATP synthase subunit E were downregulated in gliobl astoma multiform compared with non-tumor tissues. These differen tially expressed proteins provided novel information on the differences  existing between normal brain and gliomas, and thus might  prove to be useful molecular indicators of diagnostic or prognostic  value.",

    "abstract": "EGFR amplification (EGFRamp), the combination of gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 (7+/10), and TERT promoter mutation (pTERTmut) are alterations frequently observed in adult IDH-wild-type (IDHwt) glioblastoma (GBM). In the absence of endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, these alterations currently are considered to serve as a surrogate for upgrading IDHwt diffuse or anaplastic astrocytoma to GBM. Here, we set out to determine the distribution of EGFRamp, 7+/10, and pTERTmut by analyzing high-resolution copy-number profiles and next-generation sequencing data of primary brain tumors. In addition, we addressed the question whether combinations of partial gains on chromosome 7 and partial losses on chromosome 10 exhibited a diagnostic and prognostic value similar to that of complete 7+/10. Several such combinations proved relevant and were combined as the 7/10 signature. Our results demonstrate that EGFRamp and the 7/10 signature are closely associated with IDHwt GBM. In contrast, pTERTmut is less specific for IDHwt GBM. We conclude that, in the absence of endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, the detection of EGFRamp is a very strong surrogate marker for the diagnosis of GBM in IDHwt di use astrocytic tumors. The 7/10 signature is also a strong surrogate marker. However, care should be taken to exclude pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. pTERTmut is less restricted to this entity and needs companion analysis by other molecular markers to serve as a surrogate for diagnosing IDHwt GBM. A combination of any two of EGFRamp, the 7/10 signature and pTERTmut, is highly speci c for IDHwt GBM and the combination of all three alterations is frequent and exclusively seen in IDHwt GBM. ",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult primary brain tumor. Despite surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival rate is approximately 14 months. Although experimental therapies are in clinical trials for GBM, there is an urgent need for a peripheral GBM biomarker for measuring treatment response. As we have previously demonstrated that the long noncoding RNA HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA, or HOTAIR, is dysregulated in GBM and required for GBM cell proliferation, we hypothesized that HOTAIR expression may be utilized as a peripheral biomarker for GBM. HOTAIR expression was measured in serum from 43 GBM and 40 controls using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The PCR products were subsequently subcloned into pCR4-TOPOTA vectors for DNA sequencing. A ROC curve was also generated to examine HOTAIR's prognostic value. The amount of HOTAIR in serum exosomes and exosome-depleted supernatant was calculated by qRT-PCR. The relative HOTAIR expression was also investigated in 15 pairs of GBM serum and tumors. We detected HOTAIR in serum from GBM patients. HOTAIR levels in serum samples from GBM patients was significantly higher than in the corresponding controls (P < 0.0001). The area under the ROC curve distinguishing GBM patients from controls was 0.913 (95% CI: 0.845-0.982, P < 0. 0001), with 86.1% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity at the cut-off value of 10.8. HOTAIR expression was significantly correlated with high grade brain tumors. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis indicated a medium correlation of serum HOTAIR levels and the corresponding tumor HOTAIR levels (r = 0.734, P < 0.01). We confirmed via sequencing that the amplified HOTAIR from serum contained the HOTAIR sequence and maps to the known HOTAIR locus at 12q13. The serum-derived exosomes contain HOTAIR and the purified exosomes were validated by western blot and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Importantly, our results demonstrate that serum HOTAIR can be used as a novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for GBM.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to exploit a novel ligand-based delivery system for targeting diagnostic and therapeutic agents to cancers that express interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Ra2),a tumor-restricted plasma membrane receptor overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),meningiomas, peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and other peripheral tumors. On the basis of our prior work, we designed a novel IL13Ra2-targeted quadruple mutant of IL13 (TQM13) to selectively bind the tumor-restricted IL13Ra2 with high affinity but not significantly interact with the physiologically abundant IL13Ra1/IL4Ra heterodimer that is also expressed in normal brain. We then assessed the in vitro binding profile of TQM13 and its potential to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic radioactivity in vivo. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Biacore) binding experiments demonstrated that TQM13 bound strongly to recombinant IL13Ra2 (Kd5 nM). In addition, radiolabeled TQM13 specifically bound IL13Ra2-expressing GBM cells and specimens but not normal brain. Of importance, TQM13 did not functionally activate IL13Ra1/IL4Ra in cells or bind to it in SPR binding assays,in contrast to wtIL13. Furthermore, in vivo targeting of systemically delivered radiolabeled TQM13 to IL13Ra2-expressing subcutaneous tumors was demonstrated and confirmed non-invasively for the first time with 124I-TQM13 positron emission tomography imaging. In addition, 131I-TQM13 demonstrated in vivo efficacy against subcutaneous IL13Ra2-expressing GBM tumors and in an orthotopic synergeic IL13Ra2-positive murine glioma model, as evidenced by statistically significant survival advantage.

    "abstract": "ATRX is a multifunctional protein that is tightly regulated by and implicated in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Numerous studies have shown that genetic alterations in ATRX play a significant role in gliomas. This study aims to further determine the relationship between ATRX and glioma prognosis and identify possible mechanisms for exploring the biological significance of ATRX using large data sets.  Methods: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 130 immunohistochemical results to confirm the difference in ATRX mutations in high- and low-grade gliomas. An online analysis of the TCGA glioma datasets using the cBioPortal platform was performed to study the relationship between ATRX mutations and IDH1, TP53, CDKN2A and CDKN2B mutations in the corresponding TCGA glioma dataset. In combination with clinical pathology data, the biological significance of the relationships were analyzed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses and annotations of all adjacent genes in the network were performedin the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and R language. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the interactions of all adjacent nodes were analyzed by the String database and using Cytoscape software.  Results: In the selected TCGA glioma datasets, a total of 2,228 patients were queried, 21% of whom had ATRX alterations, which co-occurred frequently with TP53 and IDH1 mutations. ATRX alterations are associated with multiple critical molecular events, which results in a significantly improved overall survival (OS) rate. In low-grade gliomas, ATRX mutations are significantly associated with multiple important molecular events, such as ZNF274 and FDXR at mRNA and protein levels. A functional cluster analysis revealed that these genes played a role in chromatin binding and P53, and a link was observed between ATRX and IDH1 and TP53 in the interaction network. ATRX and TP53 are important nodes in the network and have potential links with the blood oxygen imbalance.  Conclusions: ATRX mutations have clinical implications for the molecular diagnosis of gliomas and can provide diagnostic and prognostic information for gliomas. ATRX is expected to serve as a new therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI) is an extracellular matrix protein induced by TGF-β. Previous studies have reported that the abnormal expression of TGFBI is related to the occurrence and development of some types of cancers, while the role of TGFBI in glioma is uncertain. Methods: The association between TGFBI expression and the prognosis of patients with glioma was analyzed based on data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. TGFBI expression was analyzed in 3 normal human brains and 57 cases of human gliomas by immunohistochemistry followed by an evaluation of the relationships between TGFBI expression and clinic-pathological features. Furthermore, the RNA interference plasmid pSUPER-shTGFBI was constructed and transfected into U87 and U251 cells to explore the effect of short hairpin RNA against TGFBI (shTGFBI) on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the expression of proteins related to apoptosis and proteins in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Results: High TGFBI expression was found to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Immunohistochemistry showed that TGFBI expression was significantly higher in glioma tissue than in normal human brain tissues. The expression level of TGFBI showed no significant correlation with age, sex, lymph-node metastasis, or pathological grade. sh-TGFBI could inhibit proliferation, invasion and migration and induce apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells in vitro. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR declined significantly in sh-TGFBI transfected U81 and U251 cells when compared with control. Conclusion: TGFBI was up-regulated in glioma cells and played a promoting role in the growth and motility of U87 and U251 cells. These results suggested that TGFBI has the potential to be a diagnostic marker and to serve as a target for the treatment of gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is the most common form of brain tumor and has high lethality. The authors of this study aimed to elucidate the efficiency of preoperative inflammatory markers, including neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and their paired combinations as tools for the preoperative diagnosis of glioma, with particular interest in its most aggressive form, glioblastoma (GBM).  METHODS The medical records of patients newly diagnosed with glioma, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, or nonlesional epilepsy at 3 hospitals between January 2011 and February 2016 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. The values of NLR, dNLR, PLR, LMR, and PNI were compared among patients suffering from glioma, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, and nonlesional epilepsy and healthy controls by using nonparametric tests. Correlations between NLR, dNLR, PLR, LMR, PNI, and tumor grade were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic significance of NLR, dNLR, PLR, LMR, PNI, and their paired combinations for glioma, particularly GBM.  RESULTS A total of 750 patients with glioma (Grade I, 81 patients; Grade II, 208 patients; Grade III, 169 patients; Grade IV [GBM], 292 patients), 44 with acoustic neuroma, 271 with meningioma, 102 with nonlesional epilepsy, and 682 healthy controls were included in this study. Compared with healthy controls and patients with acoustic neuroma, meningioma, or nonlesional epilepsy, the patients with glioma had higher values of preoperative NLR and dNLR as well as lower values of LMR and PNI, whereas PLR was higher in glioma patients than in healthy controls and patients with nonlesional epilepsy. Subgroup analysis revealed a positive correlation between NLR, dNLR, PLR, and tumor grade but a negative correlation between LMR, PNI, and tumor grade in glioma. For glioma diagnosis, the area under the curve (AUC) obtained from the ROC curve was 0.722 (0.697-0.747) for NLR, 0.696 (0.670-0.722) for dNLR, 0.576 (0.549-0.604) for PLR, 0.760 (0.738-0.783) for LMR, and 0.672 (0.646-0.698) for PNI. The best diagnostic performance was obtained with the combination of NLR+LMR and dNLR+LMR, with AUCs of 0.777 and 0.778, respectively. Additionally, NLR (AUC 0.860, 95% CI 0.832-0.887), dNLR (0.840, 0.810-0.869), PLR (0.678, 0.641-0.715), LMR (0.837, 0.811-0.863), and PNI (0.740, 0.706-0.773) had significant predictive value for GBM compared with healthy controls and other disease groups. As compared with the Grade I-III glioma patients, the GBM patients had an AUC of 0.811 (95% CI 0.778-0.844) for NLR, 0.797 (0.763-0.832) for dNLR, 0.662 (0.622-0.702) for PLR, 0.743 (0.707-0.779) for LMR, and 0.661(0.622-0.701) for PNI. For the paired combinations, NLR+LMR demonstrated the highest accuracy.

    "abstract": "Downregulation of miR-361-5p contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition of glioma cells. However, the relevance of miR-361-5p to migration and invasion of gliomas remains unknown.  Materials and methods: The relationship between miR-361-5p and SND1 expression was analyzed in 120 human gliomas and 8 glioma cell lines by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to identify SND1 as a target of miR-361-5p. The mechanisms through which miR-361-5p inhibits glioma cell migration and invasion were studied by in vitro assays.  Results: miR-361-5p expression was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and glioma cell lines, and was inversely correlated with glioma grades. However, SND1 expression was positively correlated with glioma grades and inversely correlated with miR-361-5p expression. miR-361-5p overexpression suppressed glioma cell migration and invasion through targeting SND1 and subsequently decreasing MMP-2 expression. In glioma cell lines, SND1 overexpression could partly reverse the antitumor effects of miR-361-5p.  Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that miR-361-5p directly targets SND1 to degradation and then reduces MMP-2 gene transcription, thus inhibiting glioma migration and invasion. miR-361-5p is an important tumor suppressor and a novel diagnostic biomarker of glioma, and miR-361-5p and SND1 are potential therapeutic candidates for malignant gliomas.",

The latest 2016 WHO 2016 revision now includes molecular data such as IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion thus restructuring glioma classiﬁcation. Direct comparative information between commonly used im- munohistochemical markers for glial tumours GFAP, MAP - 2, NOGO - A, OLIG - 2 and WT - 1 concerning quality and quantity of expression and their relation to the new molecular markers are lacking.

We found that the expression of miR-122 in the plasma of patients with gliomas was signiﬁcantly down-regulated compared to that in healthy individuals. In addition, the expression of miR122, which was signiﬁcantly correlated with WHO grade, decreased along with the development of gliomas. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed high sensitivity and speciﬁcity of miR-122 for diagnosing gliomas (sensitivity 91.9%; speciﬁcity 81.1%; area under the curve 0.939). Finally, we found that lower expression of miR-122 was correlated with poor prognosis, and miR122 was an independent prognostic parameter indicating poor prognosis for gliomas.

This study assessed the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of serum miR-29b for GBM. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of serum miR-29b in 107 patients with GBM patients, 40 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 80 healthy volunteers. The results showed that serum miR-29b levels were much lower in patients with GBM than in those with AA or healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that serum exosomal miR-29b could effectively distinguish GBM patients from AA patients or normal controls. In addition, serum exosomal miR-29b level was significantly increased after treatment. Low serum exosomal miR-29b expression was strongly associated with aggressive clinical findings and shorter survival. Moreover, the Cox regression analysis demonstrated that serum exosomal miR-29b was an independent prognostic indicator.

The present study sought to assess the expression patterns of miR-193b in patients with glioma, and investigated its clinical significance and biological function in this disease. The expression of miR-193b in the serum, tissues and cells of patients with glioma was analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Its diagnostic value was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and its prognostic value was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. Experiments on glioma cells were conducted to explore the influence of miR-193b on proliferation, migration and invasion. Increased expression of miR-193b was observed in serum, tissues and cells of patients with glioma compared with the corresponding controls (all P<0.05). miR-193b expression was associated with the World Health Organization grading and the Karnofsky Performance Scale of the patients (all P<0.05). The area under the curve of the ROC analysis of miR-193b was 0.903, indicating its high diagnostic accuracy for glioma. High expression of miR-193b was associated with poor overall survival rate in patients (P=0.002). Therefore, miR-193b is a potential independent prognostic factor in glioma. Furthermore, the overexpression of this miR in glioma cells led to increased proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas its inhibition resulted in the opposite effects on these cell behaviors (all P<0.05). Thus, the findings from the present study indicate that the overexpression of miR-193b serves as a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in glioma. The upregulation of  miR-193b expression may enhance glioma progression, and may therefore be a potential target for glioma therapy. ",

    "abstract": "Glioma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in the central nervous  system (CNS). The lack of reliable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic methods is one of the main  reasons for the high mortality of glioma. Serum has become a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and  prognosis prediction of glioma because extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry molecular components  from their parental cells. Methods: To detect EVs and perform molecular analysis of serum EVs, we established and  optimized a microbead-assisted method based on flow cytometry and estimated the efficacy of  EGFR protein expression and NLGN3 and PTTG1 mRNA in serum EVs from glioma patients (n=23)  and healthy individuals (n=12). We evaluated the ability of EGFR+ EVs to differentiate high-grade and  low-grade glioma patients and checked the correlation between EGFR in EVs and the ki-67 labeling  index (LI) in the tumor tissue. Results: We demonstrated that EGFR+ EVs are effective diagnostic and prognostic markers of  glioma. The expression of EGFR in serum EVs can accurately differentiate high-grade and low-grade  glioma patients, and EGFR in EVs positively correlates with ki-67 LI in the tumor tissue. We also  showed the potential of NLGN3 and PTTG1 mRNA in EVs for detecting glioma patients. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the protein expression of EGFR in serum EVs is an effective  diagnostic marker of glioma. EGFR in EVs highly correlates with the malignancy of glioma. We also  show the potential of NLGN3 and PTTG1 in EVs for detecting glioma. The optimized flow  cytometry with the aid of microbead-based EV enrichment show its potential as a noninvasive  method for the detection of glioma and will be beneficial to the management of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma development is often associated with alteration in the activity and expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CKDs) and cyclins, resulting in aberrant cell proliferation. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal roles of miRNAs in controlling the development and growth of glioblastoma.Here, we provide evidence for a function of miR-340 in the inhibition of glioblastoma cell proliferation.We found that miR-340 is downregulated in human glioblastoma tissue samples and several established glioblastoma cell lines. Proliferation and neurosphere formation assays revealed that miR-340 plays an oncosuppressive role in glioblastoma, and that its ectopic expression causes signifificant defect in glioblastoma cell growth. Further, using bioinformatics, luciferase assay and western blot, we found that miR-340 specififically targets the 30 UTRs of CDK6, cyclin-D1 and cyclin-D2, leading to the arrest of glioblastoma cells in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Confifirming these results, we found that re-introducing CDK6, cyclin-D1 or cyclin-D2 expression partially, but signifificantly, rescues cells from the suppression of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest mediated by miR-340.Collectively, our results demonstrate that miR-340 plays a tumor-suppressive role in glioblastoma and may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker and/or a therapeutic avenue for glioblastoma.",

Methods: We searched the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Knowledge, Embase, and PubMed databases. Related articles were assessed, and ORs with 95% CIs were calculated to examine the relationship between miRNA-200b expression levels and the World Health Organization (WHO) glioma grade, patients' sex and age, tumor size, and extent of surgical resection. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and stability of the pooled results of the included studies were also analyzed. MiR-200b expression in 87 human glioma tissues (50 high grade and 37 low grade) and matched 41 non-neoplastic brain tissues was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. Results: Five eligible studies involving 630 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. The miRNA-200b expression in glioma tissues was negatively associated with the WHO glioma grade (OR, 0.070; 95% CI, 0.007-0.678; P=0.022). No signi cant correlations were found between miRNA-200b and sex (P=0.858), age (P=0.776), tumor size (P=0.134), or extent of resection (P=0.778). In our own test, compared with non-neoplastic brain tissues, the expression level of miR-200b was signi cantly decreased in glioma tissues (tumor vs normal: 4.29±1.90 vs 10.45±2.34, P<0.001). In addition, we found that the glioma tissues from high-grade tumors (grade III and IV) had much lower miR-200b expression than glioma tissues from low grade tumors (grade I and II). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the miRNA-200 expression level may be negatively associated with the WHO glioma grade (malignancy).

Methods: The mRNAs in ceRNA networks (micNETs) of glioblastoma were investigated by constructing a  GBM ceRNA network followed by integration with a STRING protein interaction network. The prognostic  micNET markers of mesenchymal GBM were identified and validated across multiple datasets. ceRNA  interactions were identified between micNETs and miR181 family members. LY2109761, an inhibitor of  TGFBR2, demonstrated tumor-suppressive effects on both primary cultured cells and a patient-derived  xenograft intracranial model.  Results: We characterized mesenchymal glioblastoma at the mRNA-miRNA level and reported a ceRNA  network that could separate the mesenchymal subtype from other subtypes. Six genes (TGFBR2, RUNX1,  PPARG, ACSL1, GIT2 and RAP1B) that interacted with each other in both a ceRNA-related manner and in  terms of their protein functions were identified as markers of the mesenchymal subtype. The coding sequence  (CDS) and 3-untranslated region (UTR) of TGFBR2 upregulated the expression of these genes, whereas  TGFBR2 inhibition by siRNA or miR-181a/d suppressed their expression levels. Furthermore, mesenchymal  subtype-related genes and the invasion phenotype could be reversed by suppressing the six mesenchymal  marker genes.  Conclusions: This study suggests that the micNETs may have translational significance in the diagnosis of  mesenchymal GBM and may be novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Background: Glioma accounts for a large proportion of cancer, and an effective treatment for this disease is still lacking because of the absence of specific driver molecules. Current challenges in the treatment of glioma are the accurate and timely diagnosis of brain glioma and targeted treatment plans. To investigate the diagnostic biomarkers and prospective role of miRNAs in the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs and key genes in glioma based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database.  Methods: Of the 701 cases that were downloaded, five were normal and 696 were glioma. Then, 1626 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 173 aberrantly expressed miRNAs were calculated by edgeR. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Cytoscape software. A coexpression network was built by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). A cell scratch test and transwell, cell apoptosis and cell cycle assays were performed to validate the function of hsa-let-7b-5p.  Results: Based on crosstalk genes in the KEGG, PPI network, and WGCNA analyses, PLK1, CCNA2, cyclin B2 (CCNB2), and AURKA were screened as candidate diagnostic marker genes. The survival analysis revealed that high mRNA expression of PLK1, CCNA2, and AURKA was significantly associated with poor overall survival. Furthermore, hsalet-7b-5p was identified as a core miRNA in the regulation of candidate genes involved in glioma development. We confirmed that hsa-let-7b-5p could inhibit the migration, invasion, and cell cycle of glioma cells.  Conclusions: This study provides four potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of glioma, offers a potential explanation of its pathogenesis, and proposes hsa-let-7b-5p as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Background: Glioblastomas have a high degree of malignancy, high recurrence rate, high mortality rate, and low cure rate. Searching for new markers of glioblastomas is of great signifcance for improving the diagnosis, prognosis  and treatment of glioma. Methods: Using the GEO public database, we combined 34 glioma microarray datasets containing 1893 glioma  samples and conducted genetic data mining through statistical analysis, bioclustering, and pathway analysis. The  results were validated in TCGA, CGGA, and internal cohorts. We further selected a gene for subsequent experiments  and conducted cell proliferation and cell cycle analyses to verify the biological function of this gene. Results: Eight glioblastoma-specifc diferentially expressed genes were screened using GEO. In the TCGA and CGGA  cohorts, patients with high CBX3, BARD1, EGFR, or IFRD1 expression had signifcantly shorter survival but patients  with high GUCY1A3 or MOBP expression had signifcantly longer survival than patients with lower expression of these  genes. After reviewing the literature, we selected the CBX3 gene for further experiments. We confrmed that CBX3 was  overexpressed in glioblastoma by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays and qPCR analysis of surgical  specimens. The functional assay results showed that silencing CBX3 arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, thereby  weakening the cell proliferation ability. Conclusions: We used a multidisciplinary approach to analyze glioblastoma samples in 34 microarray datasets,  revealing novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with glioblastoma and providing a new direction for  screening tumor markers.",

Since new diagnostic methods such as methylome-based classification of brain tumors are more and more frequently performed, we aimed at comparing the suitability of calculating the MGMT promoter methylation status in a quantitative manner from the methylome profiling as compared to the classic gold standard assessment by PCR.Methods: Our cohort consisted of 39 cases diagnosed as \"glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype\" of which the MGMT promoter methylation status was analyzed with both methylation-specific PCR and high density DNA methylation array using the STP-27 algorithm. Contradictory results were validated by pyrosequencing.Results: The inter-method reliability reached 77% (kappa-coefficient: 0.58) when also cases with an inconclusive result in one or the other method were taken into account. When only cases with conclusive results in both methods were considered, a very high inter-method reliability of 91% (kappa-coefficient: 0.86) could be achieved. For \"methylated\" cases, no contradictory results were obtained. For the remaining two cases with discrepant results subsequent pyrosequencing analyses spoke in favor of each previously applied method once. Conclusion: In addition to its benefits for molecular subgrouping and copy number analysis of brain tumors,DNA-methylation based classification is a highly reliable tool for the assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status in glioblastoma patients.",

However, disease onset is most prevalent in the fifirst two decades of life, and children are often left with residual or recurrent disease and signifificant morbidity. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway regulates the growth of higher WHO grade gliomas, and in this study, we have evaluated the activation and operational status of this regulatory pathway in pilocytic astrocytomas. Expression levels of the Hh pathway transcriptional target PTCH were elevated in 45% of tumor specimens analyzed (ages 1 -22 years) and correlated inversely with patient age. Evaluation of a tissue array revealed oligodendroglioma-like features, pilomyxoid features, infifiltration, and necrosis more commonly in specimens from younger patients (below the median patient age of 10 years). Immunohistochemical staining for the Hh pathway components PTCH and GLI1 and the proliferation marker Ki67 demonstrated that patients diagnosed before the age of 10 had higher staining indices than those diagnosed after the age of 10. A signifificant correlation between Ki67 and PTCH and GLI1 staining indices was measured, and 86% of Ki67-positive cells also expressed PTCH.

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that the developmentally regulated gene, SOXO, is strongly expressed in glioma cells and in the fetal brain, but only faintly in the normal adult brain. Recent studies have indicated that brain tumor cells may share antigens, signaling systems, and behavior with neural stem/progenitor cells. To test the validity of this proposition, we analyzed the expression of SOX6 in various human central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors expressed SOX6; neuronal-glial cell tumors (central neurocytoma) and embryonal tumors (medulloblastoma), which arise from multipotential stem cell precursors, also showed a high intensity of SOX6 staining. In contrast, ependymal tumors (ependymoma and subependymoma), meningioma, and schwannoma, which are all well differentiated tumors, showed either no staining or only faint staining for SOX6. These results suggest that SOX6 may be expressed in bipotential or multipotential cells capable of neuronal and glial differentiation, but not in fully differentiated cells.

    "abstract": "The methylation-mediated silencing of tumor suppressors, including key apoptosis-related genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance in human cancer. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role and mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis with caspase-8 gene downregulation in human malignant glioma. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and methylation-speci c PCR (MSP) were used to examine caspase-8 expressoin at the mRNA level and gene methylation status in normal brain tissue, glioma tissue and cancer cell lines. Caspase-8 protein kinase activity was measured by caspase-8 colorimetric assays; cell apoptosis was examined by Annexin V/ propidium iodide (PI) staining; the rates of tumor cell apoptosis were detected by ow cytometry. Our results revealed that caspase-8 gene silencing may result from the methylation of its gene promoter in human glioma tissues. The expression of caspase-8 at the mRNA level was significantly associated with the grade of human glioma. In certain human cancer cell lines, the expression at the mRNA level, protein kinase activity and tumor cell anti-apoptotic activity and resistance were related to the methylation status of the caspase-8 gene promoter. Thus, the caspase-8 gene methylation status may be used as an indicator for the early diagnosis of human malignant glioma. Combination therapy with demethylation reagents may overcome therapeutic resistance in the same malignancy. ",

FRAT1 has  recently been identifified as a proto-oncogene involved in  tumorigenesis, as elevated expression of FRAT1 was  detected in several types of human cancers. However, the  relationship between FRAT1 and human astrocytomas is  unclear. In this study, we detected the expression of FRAT1  in 76 patients with human astrocytoma by immunohisto chemistry. The proliferative index (PI) of tumor cells was  evaluated by Ki-67 staining, and the apoptotic index (AI)  was determined by flfluorometric TdT-mediated dUTP nick  end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The results showed that the  FRAT1 immunoreactivity score (IRS), PI, and AI of astro cytoma were 4.11 ± 3.86, 31.92 ± 20.00%, and 2.66 ±  1.66%, respectively, and all of them increased markedly  with the increase of pathologic grade of astrocytomas (P\\0.001 for all). The PI in the FRAT1-positive group was  signifificantly higher than that in the FRAT1-negative group  (P\\0.001). In addition, the PI was positively correlated  with FRAT1 IRS (P\\0.001). Although there was no sig nifificant difference between the AI in the FRAT1-positive  group and that in the FRAT1-negative group (P = 0.123),  the AI was inversely correlated with FRAT1 IRS  (P = 0.022).

    "abstract": "Background: The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with a variety of diseases including cancers. In the present study, the miRNA expression profile was examined in astrocytoma, a malignant and prevalent intracranial tumour in adults. Methods: We screened the expression profile of 200 miRNAs in a training sample set consisting of 84 astrocytoma samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples using the method of stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR. The significantly altered miRNAs were validated in another independent sample set consisting of 40 astrocytoma samples and 40 NAT samples. The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: After a two-phase selection and validation process, seven miRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples upon comparison to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the great potential of the 7-miRNA profile to differentiate between tumours and normal brain tissues. The down-regulation of hsa-miR-137 in astrocytomas was shown to be associated with advanced clinical stages of this disease. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis we showed that low expression of hsa-miR-181b or hsa-miR-106a, or high expression of hsa-miR-21 was significantly associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors. Conclusions: Our results suggest a great potential for the use of miRNA profiling as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic marker in defining the signature of astrocytomas and in predicting the post-surgical outcome.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We detected expression of miR-214 in medium from 2 glioma cell lines to confirm whether it is secretory in screening phase. Then, we verified cell-free miR-214 expression in serum samples from an independent set of 100 preoperative patients with glioma, 30 matching postoperative patients, and 100 healthy controls.  RESULTS: MiR-214 was secreted from glioma cell lines. Extracellular miR-214 levels were significantly overexpressed in preoperative serum from glioma patients with glioma, whereas its expression significantly decreased in matched postoperative serum. Upregulated cell-free miR214 in serum was significantly associated with higher tumor grade, absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and unmethylated methylguanine methyltransferase promoter. Extracellular miR-214 in serum could effectively distinguish patients with glioma from healthy control (area under the curve [ 0.885; 95% confidence interval, 0.833e0.926).

    "abstract": "Malignant gliomas, the most frequent primary brain tumors, are characterized by a dismal prognosis. Reliable biomarkers complementary to neuroradiology in the differential diagnosis of gliomas and monitoring for postsurgical progression are unmet needs. Altered expression of several microRNAs in tumour tissues from patients with gliomas compared to normal brain tissue have been described, thus supporting the rationale of using microRNA-based biomarkers. Although different circulating microRNAs were proposed in association with gliomas, they have not been introduced into clinical practice so far. Blood samples were collected from patients with high and low grade gliomas, both before and after surgical resection, and the expression of miR-21, miR-222 and miR-124-3p was measured in exosomes isolated from serum. The expression levels of miR-21, miR-222 and miR-124-3p in serum exosomes of patients with high grade gliomas were significantly higher than those of low grade gliomas and healthy controls and were sharply decreased in samples obtained after surgery. The analysis of miR-21, miR-222 and miR-124-3p in serum exosomes of patients affected by gliomas can provide a minimally invasive and innovative tool to help the differential diagnosis of gliomas at their onset in the brain and predict glioma grading and non glial metastases before surgery.",

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Spearman correlation analysis were used to determine differential expressions of miR-338-5p and TSHZ3 in astrocytic gliomas of different grades (n = 35) and glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and U251) in comparison to non-neoplastic brain (NNB) tissues (n = 6). Western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of TSHZ3 and MMP2 in glioblastoma cell lines and Matrigel invasion assay to examine the role of miR-338-5p in cell invasiveness. The results showed that the expression of miR-338-5p, normalized to hsnRNA U6, was signifificantly higher in grade III and IV gliomas and glioblastoma cell lines compared to that in NNB and grade II gliomas, whereas TSHZ3 expression, normalized to GAPDH, was inversely related to miR-338-5p (R = -0.636, P\\0.01). Luciferase assays showed TSHZ3 to be a target gene of miR-338-5p. In both U87 and U251 cells, miR-338-5p mimics increased MMP2 and invasiveness of the cells. Overexpression of ectopic TSHZ3 suppressed the cell invasiveness and attenuated the pro-invasive effect of miR-338-5p mimics. Overall, our results showed that miR-338-5p has a function in promoting glioma cell invasion by targeting TSHZ3 suppression on MMP2.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most common malignant primary tumors and develops in brain. The molecular mechanism that regulates glioblastoma occurrence still remains unknown. MicroRNA (miR) -500a-5p has been reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer. Whether miR-500a-5p regulates glioblastoma progression requires further investigation. In the present study, miR-500a-5p was highly expressed in malignant glioblastoma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-500a-5p promoted glio blastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. In addition, knockdown of miR-500a-5p accelerated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-500a-5p inhibition significantly impaired tumor growth in vivo. The present study further explored the downstream mechanism. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-500a-5p directly binds the 3-untranslated region of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) mRNA. MiR-500a-5p markedly inhibited CHD5 expression in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, CHD5 was downregulated in glioblastoma tissues, and the expression levels of miR-500a-5p and CHD5 were inversely correlated. In addition, knockdown of CHD5 restored the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration triggered by miR-500a-5p silence. Finally, it was demonstrated that miR-500a-5p can serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that miR-500a-5p may have promoted glioblastoma development and progression by targeting CHD5.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is the most common malignancy of the central nervous system. Approximately 40 percent of intracranial tumors are diagnosed as gliomas. Difficulties in treatment are associated closely with the malignant phenotype, which is characterized by excessive proliferation, relentless invasion, and angiogenesis. Although the comprehensive treatment level of brain glioma is continuously progressing, the outcome of this malignancy has not been improved drastically. Therefore, the identification of new biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy of this malignancy is of significant scientific and clinical value. FRAT1 is a positive regulator of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway and is overexpressed in many human tumors. In the present study, we investigated the expression status of FRAT1 in 68 patients with human gliomas and its correlation with the pathologic grade, proliferation, invasion,angiogenesis, and prognostic significance. These findings suggest that FRAT1 may be an important factor in the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma and could be explored as a potential biomarker for pathological diagnosis, an indicator for prognosis, and a target for biological therapy of malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Aims: NDRG2 (N-myc downstream regulated gene 2) gene is involved in important biological processes: cell differentiation, growth and apoptosis. Several molecular studies have shown NDRG2 as a promising diagnostic marker involved in brain tumor pathology. The aim of the study was to investigate how changes in epigenetic modification and activity of NDRG2 reflect on glioma malignancy and patient outcome. Methods: 137 different malignancy grade gliomas were used as the study material: 14 pilocytic astrocytomas grade I, 45 diffuse astrocytomas grade II, 29 anaplastic astrocytomas grade III, and 49 grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastomas). Promoter methylation analysis has been carried out by using methylation-specific PCR, whereas RT-PCR and Western-blot analyses were used to measure NDRG2 expression levels. Results: We demonstrated that NDRG2 gene methylation frequency increased whereas expression at both mRNA and protein levels markedly decreased in glioblastoma specimens compared to the lower grade astrocytomas.NDRG2 transcript and protein levels did not correlate with the promoter methylation state,suggesting the presence of alternative regulatory gene expression mechanisms that may operate in a tissue-specific manner in gliomas. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed significant differences in survival time in gliomas stratified by NDRG2 methylation status and mRNA and protein expression levels. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the usefulness of combining epigenetic data to gene expression patterns at mRNA and protein level in tumor biomarker studies, and suggest that NDRG2 downregulation might bear influence on glioma tumor progression while being associated with higher malignancy grade.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary malignancy in the brain and confers a uniformly poor prognosis. MicroRNAs have been shown to activate or inhibit tumorigenesis. Abnormalities in the p53 signaling pathway are found in various cancers and correlate with tumor formation. We examined the expression of microRNA-141-3p (miR-141-3p) in glioma of different grades by analysis of expression profiling databases and clinical specimens. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate the promotion of miR-141-3p in proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and temozolomide resistance of glioblastoma cells in vitro.Bioinformatics analyses, luciferase reporter assays, and immunoblotting showed that p53 is a target gene of miR-141-3p. A significant inverse correlation was observed between expression of miR-141-3p and p53 in glioma and normal brain tissues (R2=0.506, P<0.0001). Rescue experiments indicated that overexpression of p53 significantly reversed the alterations in proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and temozolomide resistance measured by cell apoptosis induced by miR-141-3p overexpression. In an orthotopic mouse model of human glioma, inhibition of miRNA-141-3p reduced the proliferation and growth of glioma cells in the brain and significantly prolonged the survival of glioma-bearing mice. We suggest that miR-141-3p promotes glioblastoma progression and temozolomide resistance by altering p53 expression and therefore may serve as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma in the future.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to examine the possibility of using plasma miR-199a-3p as a biomarker for glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma miR-199a- 3p expression glioma patients and normal healthy controls were quantified by Quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Then, the associations of serum miR-199a-3p level with clinicopathological factors or survival of glioma patients were further evaluated. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to validate the diagnostic value of miR-199a-3p. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were finally performed to analyze the independent factors for overall survival. RESULTS: The qRT-PCR results showed that the miR-199a-3p expression was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.01). Furthermore, plasma miR-199a-3p level was significantly lower in glioma patients when compared with healthy controls (p<0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that plasma miR-199a-3p was a useful marker for discriminating cases from healthy controls, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.8466 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.772 to 0.9211, p<0.001). Moreover, miR- 199a-3p expression was associated with various clinicopathological parameters, including WHO grade (p=0.001) and KPS score (p=0.008). We found that glioma patients with low miR-199a- 3p expression level had distinctly shorter overall survival than patients with high miR-199a- 3p expression level (p=0.0067).

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene function in a wide range of pathophysiological processes and are therefore emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer, hepatic cancer, and other tumor diseases. However, the effective use of lncRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis of glioma remains unproven. Methods:This study included 42 glioma patients and 10 healthy controls. lncRNA and mRNA microarray chips were used to identify dysregulated lncRNAs in tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue, and SYBR Green-based miRNA quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were used to validate upregulated lncRNAs. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the lncRNA identified as the candidate biomarker. Results:miR210HG levels were significantly higher in tumor tissue than in tumor-adjacent normal tissue in participating glioma patients. Serum miR210HG levels were also significantly higher in glioma patients than in healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that serum miR210HG was a specific diagnostic predictor of acute pulmonary embolism with an area under the curve of 0.8323 (95% confidence interval, 0.7347 to 0.9299, p < 0.001).

All cases were immunostained with Olig-2, Nogo-A, and synaptophysin. In 79 cases, the status of 1p/19q had already been assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thus, in selected cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization was repeated in areas with numerous Nogo-A-positive neoplastic cells. Nogo-A was positive in 18 (75%) of 24 oligodendrogliomas, 8 (80%) of 10 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, 6 (20%) of 30 glioblastoma multiforme, and 2 (20%) of 10 pilocytic astrocytomas.

Finally, synaptophysin stained 13 (54.1%) of 24 oligodendrogliomas, 3 (10%) of 30 glioblastoma multiforme, 1 (10%) of 10 pilocytic astrocytomas, and all neurocytomas.

    "abstract": "The prognosis of glioma is generally poor and is the cause of primary malignancy in the brain. The role of microRNAs has been implicated in tumour inhibition or activation. In several cancers, the Six1 signalling pathway has been found to be aberrant and also relates to the formation of tumours. We analysed the database for expression profiles and clinical specimens of various grades of glioma to assess microRNA-155-3p (miR-155-3p) expression. The role of miR-155-3p in glioblastoma, cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis and resistance to temozolomide was assessed in vitro through flow cytometry and cell proliferation assays. Bioinformatics analyses, and assays using luciferase reporter, and immunoblotting revealed that miR-155-3p targets Six1 and that the relationship between glioma and healthy brain tissues was significantly inverse. In rescue experiments, overexpressed Six1 revoked the changes in cell cycle distribution, proliferation and resistance to temozolomide estimated by apoptosis induced by overexpressed miR-155-3p. MiR-155-3p inhibition reduced glioma cell growth and proliferation in the brain of a mouse model and increased the survival of mice with gliomas. Thus, miR-155-3p modulates Six1 expression and facilitates the progression of glioblastoma and resistance to temozolomide and may act as a novel diagnostic biomarker and a target for glioma treatment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the correlations of micro ribonucleic acid (miR)-126 expression with pathogenesis and prognosis of glioma, and to screen potential biological targets for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of glioma.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: miR-126 expression in cancer tissues, normal brain tissues, U87MG cells and normal astrocytes in glioma patients was quantitatively analyzed via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). U87MG cells were transfected with miR-126 mimics or miR-126 inhibitor, followed by veri cation via qRT-PCR. The cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion after transfection were analyzed using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. The expression levels of proteins related to phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PTEN/PI3K/Akt) pathway and double mouse minute 2 homolog (MDM2)-p53 pathway were detected via Western blotting. Moreover, the prognostic analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.  RESULTS: Results of qRT-PCR showed that the miR-126 expression in highly malignant glioma tissues and U87MG cells were significantly lower than those in normal brain cells, and its expression level was significantly higher or lower than that in negative control group after transfection with miR-126 mimics or inhibitor. Analyses of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion revealed that the up-regulation of miR-126 could remarkably inhibit the in-vitro proliferation, migration and invasion and promote apoptosis of glioma cells, and vice versa. Results of Western blotting manifested that after overexpression of miR-126, PI3K, p-Akt and MDM2 protein levels in U87MG cells were significantly decreased compared with those in control group, but PTEN and p53 protein expressions were significantly increased, and vice versa. Besides, according to prognostic analysis, the prognosis of patients with a low miR-126 level was poorer.  CONCLUSIONS: The miR-126 expression is abnormally low in glioma cells, and miR-126 inhibits the course of glioma through targeted regulation of PTEN/PI3K/Akt and MDM2-p53 pathways, which, therefore, can be used as a new potential biomarker for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of glioma.

    "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most malignant adult glial brain tumor, remains poor in spite of advances in treatment procedures, including surgical resection, irradiation and chemotherapy. Genetic heterogeneity of GBM warrants extensive studies to gain a thorough understanding of the biology of this tumor. While there have been several studies of global transcript pro ling of glioma with the identification of gene signatures for diagnosis and disease management, translation into clinics is yet to happen. In the present study, we report a novel proteomic approach by using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by spot picking and analysis of proteins/peptides by Mass Spectrometry. We report Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) as a differentially expressed protein in the GBM cell line compared to human normal Astrocyte cells.  In addition to proteomic studies, we performed microarray analysis which further confirmed up regulation of GRP78 in GBM cells compared to human normal Astrocyte cells.  GRP78 has long been recognized as a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and can be induced by the ER stress response. Besides its location in the ER, GRP78 has been found in cell plasma membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus and other cellular secretions. GRP78 is implicated in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, immune escape, metastasis and angiogenesis, and its elevated expression usually correlates with a variety of tumor micro environmental stresses, including hypoxia, glucose deprivation, lactic acidosis and inflammatory response. GRP78 protein acts as a centrally located sensor of stress, which senses and facilitates the adaptation to the tumor microenvironment.  Our findings showed differential expression of this gene in brain cancer GBM and thus con rm similarities in findings in existing transcriptional and translational studies. Thus, these findings could be of further importance for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic approaches for dealing with this highly malignant cancer.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Glioma is one of the most aggressive human tumors; however, little is known about its genetic risk factors. The role of heredity is likely to be explained by combinations of common low-risk variants. Previous studies have indicated that more than 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with the risk of glioma. Methods: To further investigate how and to what extentthese SNPs contribute to glioma susceptibility in a Chinese population, we analyzed 43 SNPs of 226 glioma patients and 254 normal people in order to evaluate the associations between SNPs and the risk of glioma. Results:Overall, we found three protective alleles for glioma in patients: the allele \"G\" of rs1801275 in the IL4R gene by allele model (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.99; P = 0.04) and dominant model (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99; P = 0.04) analysis respectively, the allele \"T\" of rs17748 in the TREH gene by recessive model (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-1.01; P = 0.05) analysis, and the allele \"G\" of rs6470745 in CCDC26 gene by recessive model (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.89; P = 0.02) analysis.Conclusion: This study provides evidence for three glioma susceptibility genes - TREH, IL4R and CCDC26-in a Chinese population; this may shed light on molecular markers of glioma susceptibility and could therefore be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for glioma patients in clinical study.",

In the current study, we investigated the potential use of serum miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in a cohort of Chinese astrocytoma patients. Methods. An initial screening of the circulating miRNA expression profile was performed on pooled serum samples from 10 preoperative patients and 10 healthy controls using a TaqMan low-density array. The selected serum miRNAs were then validated in90 preoperative patients and 110 healthy controls who were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. An additionaldouble-blind test was performed in 50 astrocytomas and 50 controls to assess the serum miRNA-based biomarker accuracy in predicting astrocytoma. The differentially expressed miRNAs were evaluated in paired preoperative and postoperative serum samples from 73 astrocytoma patients. The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated. Results. Nine serum miRNAs were significantly increased in the astrocytoma patients. The biomarker composed of these 9 miRNAs had high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These 9 miRNAs were markedly decreased in the serum after operation. The upregulation of miR-20a-5p, miR-106a-5p, and miR-181b-5p was associated with advanced clinical stages of astrocytoma. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high expression of miR-19a-3p, miR-106a-5p, and miR-181b-5p was significantly associated with poor patient survival.

    "abstract": "Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein containing an RNA template that synthesizes telomeric DNA. The expression of telomerase activity is concomitant with the attainment of immortality in tumor tissues and cells. In this report, we analyzed telomerase activity in 39 human gliomas with different histological, and in 10 meningiomas, 3 neurinomas, and 2 normal brain tissues by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Telomerase activity was detectable in almost all of the gliomas (36 of 39), but not in any of the meningiomas, neurinomas, or normal brain tissues. In addition, we also analyzed the level of telomerase activity in the 36 gliomas with positive telomerase activity. The relative telomerase activity of the glioma showed a clear association with the pathological grade of glioma; i.e., most of the tumors with high telomerase activity were pathologically of high grade. And also the relative level of telomerase activity could be correlated with the survival time of the patients. These results suggest that the level of telomerase activity in brain tumors is a diagnostic marker indicating the prognosis of the patient as well as the malignant potential of the tumor.",

    "abstract": "Background and aim Glioblastoma multiform (GBM); most fatal brain cancer, is incurable with molecular diversity hence identification of molecular targets that contribute to GBM tumorgenesis will be suitable for the development of diagnostic and treatment strategies. Micro-RNAs (miR); small RNA molecules, are stable in blood and play a crucial role in molecular processes in GBM. Thus it was aimed to investigate the clinical role of miR-221 and miR-222 among GBM cases as compared to healthy individuals and illustrate their role in patient's survival. Materials and methods Blood samples were withdrawn from 20 GBM cases before and after treatment, a group of 20 healthy individuals were served as control. For all enrolled samples expression of miR-221 and miR-222 were detected using quantitative PCR (QPCR). Sensitivities, specificities of investigated miRs and their relation with GBM clinical characteristics and patient's outcome were analyzed using Kaplan Meir curve. Results Expression of investigated miR- 221 and -222 were significantly increased in GBM cases as compared to healthy individuals (F = 12.9, at P < 0.001, F = 28.78, at P < 0.0001, respectively) and with absolute specificity for both and 90% sensitivity for miR-221 and 85% for miR-222. Among GBM patients (n = 20), mean expression level miR-221 reported significant increase with elder GBM ( > 60 years) at F = 5.7, P = 0.028, while both miR-221 and -222 showed significant difference in performance status (ECGO) at P = 0.036 and 0.007, patients with primary lesion at P = 0.001 and 0.005, surgically treatment strategy at P < 0.001 and 0.004, respectively. Patients were grouped according to their outcomes into response (complete [CR] or partial [PR]), stable disease[SD] and progressive disease [PD], miR-221 and miR-222 showed increase expression with PD and patients with worse PFS and OS were those with high miRs expression.

    "abstract": "Duplication of 7q34 resulting in generation of BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts is a characteristic event in pilocytic astrocytoma that may also aid distinction from diffuse astrocytic tumours. As data on BRAFKIAA1549 fusion transcript status remain mainly limited to children, we aimed to examine the diagnostic value of BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts across all age groups. Methods: BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcript status was examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of 105 primary pilocytic astrocytomas [median patient age: 17 years (1-74 years)]. Results: Informative results (distinct wildtype BRAF bands detectable) were obtained in 105/124 cases (85%). Fusion transcripts were detected in 53 of cases (51%). They were more often encountered in tumours of infratentorial location [42/67 (63%) vs. 11/38 (29%)] and comprised KIAA1549-Ex16_BRAFEx9 (32 cases), KIAA1549-Ex15_BRAF-Ex9 (14 cases) and KIAA1549-Ex16_BRAF-Ex11 (seven cases). Fusion transcripts were present in 79% of tumours diagnosed in the first decade of life, but only in 51% of patients aged 11-20 years, 42% of patients aged 21-30 years, 30% of patients aged 31-40 years and 7% of patients older than 40 years. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the association of fusion transcript status and age was con- firmed adjusting for tumour location (P = 0.006). Conclusions: The frequency of BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion transcripts is significantly lower in adult patients with pilocytic astrocytoma, weakening the sensitivity of this specific diagnostic marker in that age group.",

    "abstract": "The oligodendroglioma (OG) type of glial cell tumors accounts for 2-5% of primary brain neoplasms and 4-15% of gliomas diagnosed worldwide. Allelic losses on 1p, or on 1p and 19q, correlate with chemotherapy response and good prognosis in OG patients; however,the underlying mechanisms are not yet clearly defined. Therefore, we utilized a quantitative proteomics strategy that combined 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling and two-dimensional liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC/MS/MS) to identify molecular signatures, reveal mechanisms, and develop predictive markers of OG patients with 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH). An initial screening of four OG patients with 1p LOH and four without were identified,and 449 differentially expressed proteins were quantified, 13 of which were significantly different between the two groups. Analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway suggested that 1p LOH may affect the actin network in OG. The differential expression of four of the 13 candidates (UBA1, ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1; ATP6V1E1, ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 31 kDa, V1 subunit E1; MAP2,microtubule-associated protein 2; and HMGB1, high-mobility group protein B1) was validated in 39 additional OG samples using immunohistochemistry. Decision tree modeling indicated that MAP2 expression is a powerful predictor of 1p LOH. Our results not only demonstrate the utility of iTRAQ-based high-throughput quantitative proteomic analysis in glioma research, but also provide novel markers that may help to reveal the mechanisms of 1p LOH-associated chemosensitivity, and to design diagnostic and prognostic assays and therapeutics for OG.",

In addition, TMEM39A seems to be implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus. However, any possible involvement of TMEM39A in cancer remains largely unknown. In the present report, we provide evidence that TMEM39A may play a role in brain tumors. Western blotting using an anti-TMEM39A antibody indicated that TMEM39A was overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines, including U87-MG and U251-MG. Deep-sequencing transcriptomic profiling of U87-MG and U251-MG cells revealed that TMEM39A transcripts were upregulated in such cells compared with those of the cerebral cortex. Confocal microscopic analysis of U251-MG cells stained with anti-TMEM39A antibody showed that TMEM39A was located in dot-like structures lying close to the nucleus. TMEM39A probably located to mitochondria or to endosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of glioma tissue specimens indicated that TMEM39A was markedly upregulated in such samples. Bioinformatic analysis of the Rembrandt knowledge base also supported upregulation of TMEM39A mRNA levels in glioma patients. Together, the results afford strong evidence that TMEM39A is upregulated in glioma cell lines and glioma tissue specimens. Therefore, TMEM39A may serve as a novel diagnostic marker of, and a therapeutic target for, gliomas and other cancers. ",

It has preliminarily been demonstrated that MAGE-D4 mRNA is not expressed in majority of normal tissues except for brain and ovary in which only trace amount of MAGE-D4 mRNA can be detected, but predominantly expressed in glioma. MAGE-D4 protein expression and its immunogenicity in glioma have not been elucidated well. This study was designed to analyze MAGE-D4 expression both at mRNA and protein level, characteristic of humoral immune response, and their relationships with glioma patients' clinicopathological parameters. Recombinant MAGE-D4 protein and antiserum were generated. Quantitative RT- PCR analysis revealed that MAGE-D4 mRNA expression was overall up-regulated in 41 glioma specimens compared with that in 14 normal brain tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that 78% (21/27) glioma tissues expressed MAGE-D4 protein, which was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, but absent in any neuroglia cell of normal brain tissues. ELISA analysis demonstrated that humoral response against MAGE-D4 was detected in 17% (7/41) of glioma patients' sera but not in 77 healthy donors. No apparent correlation was observed between the expression and immunogenicity of MAGE-D4 with clinicopathological parameters of glioma. In summary, these results indicate that MAGE-D4 is highly expressed in glioma and can develop specifically humoral response in glioma patients, which supports that it may be a promising biomarker for glioma diagnosis and immunotherapy.

    "abstract": "Background Previous nested case-control studies suggest that a prediagnostic biomarker of allergy, IgE, is inversely associated with the risk of glioma, but these findings are inconsistent. The purpose of our study was to assess this association and determine how long before glioma diagnosis it may be observed. Methods We conducted a nested case-control study using serum specimens from the Janus Serum Bank cohort in Norway. Blood donors who were subsequently diagnosed with glioma (n = 594 case subjects), between January 1, 1974 to December 31, 2007, were matched with subjects without glioma (n = 1177 control subjects) for date of blood collection, 2-year age interval at blood collection, and sex. Respiratory allergen-specific and total IgE levels in the serum were measured using fluorescent assays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression models stratified on sex and glioblastoma, the most common glioma subtype. Data were stratified on time from blood collection to tumor diagnosis to assess how long before glioma diagnosis the association could be observed. Results Among women, testing positive for allergen-specific IgE (>0.35 kUA/L) was associated with decreased risk of glioblastoma compared with testing negative (0.35 kUA/L; OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.93). Among both sexes combined, testing positive for total IgE (>100 kU/L) was associated with decreased risk of glioma compared with testing negative (100 kU/L; OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.99), and simultaneously testing positive for allergenspecific IgE and total IgE was associated with a borderline statistically significantly decreased risk of glioblastoma and glioma compared with simultaneously testing negative for these types of IgE. Testing positive for total IgE at least 20 years before diagnosis was associated with decreased risk of glioma compared with testing negative (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.99). Conclusion An inverse association between IgE levels and risk of glioma was detected; the association was present at least 20 years before tumor diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway is activated in multiple advanced cancers, including glioblastomas, through inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Recently, mutations in PIK3CA, a member of the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunits, were identified in a significant fraction (25-30%) of colorectal cancers, gastric cancers, and glioblastomas and in a smaller fraction of breast and lung cancers. These mutations were found to cluster into two major \"hot spots\" located in the helical and catalytic domains. To determine whether PIK3CA is genetically altered in brain tumors, we performed a large-scale mutational analysis of the helical and catalytic domains. A total of 13 mutations of PIK3CA within these specific domains were identified in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, glioblastoma multiforme, and medulloblastomas, whereas no mutations were identified in ependymomas or low-grade astrocytomas.

In this study,  we aimed to explore the potential role of H19/miR‐675/vitamin D receptor (VDR) in  the effect of CUR against glioma. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction and western‐  blot analysis were used to study the effect of CUR or 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D  (1,25(OH)2D3) on the expression of H19, miR‐675, and VDR. In addition, the effect  of H19 on VDR expression was also studied. Furthermore, the expression of H19,  miR‐675, and VDR between CUR‐loaded nanoparticles (NPs) and NP groups was  compared, and the interaction among H19, miR‐675, and VDR was analyzed by in‐  silicon and luciferase assays. In a dose‐dependent manner, CUR and 1,25(OH)2D3  both downregulated the expression of H19 and miR‐675 but increased the expression  of VDR. In addition, H19 evidently reduced the mRNA and protein levels of VDR.  Furthermore, VDR was confirmed as a target gene of miR‐675, which significantly  reduced the expression of VDR. Finally, the administration of CUR evidently  decreased tumor volume. CUR‐loaded NP group exhibited lower levels of H19 and  miR‐675, while the NP group showed higher levels of VDR mRNA and protein. In  summary, it is the first time that the involvement of a negative feedback loop of  H19/miR‐675/VDR has been demonstrated in the development of glioma. Therefore,  H19 might serve as a new biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of glioma.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE High-grade gliomas, such as glioblastoma (GBM), are devastating tumors with a very poor prognosis. Previously the authors have found that the nitrone compound OKN-007 (OKlahoma Nitrone 007; or disodium 4-[(tertbutyl-imino) methyl] benzene-1,3-disulfonate N-oxide) is effective against high-grade gliomas in various GBM rodent and human xenograft models. The purpose of the present study was to assess the levels of the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) in rodent gliomas treated with OKN-007 as well as determine the expression of LBP in human gliomas.  METHODS Microarray analysis was done to assess altered gene expression following OKN-007 administration in an F98 glioma model. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was incorporated to assess LBP levels in glioma tissues, as well as blood serum, comparing results in OKN-007-treated and untreated tumor-bearing animals. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess LBP levels in varying grades of human glioma tissue sections.  RESULTS Upon further assessment of gene expression fold changes in F98 gliomas in rats that received or did not receive OKN-007, it was found that the gene for LBP was significantly downregulated by OKN-007. Further investigation was done to see whether levels of LBP were affected by OKN-007 treatment in F98 gliomas. It was found that LBP could be detected not only in glioma tissue but also in blood serum of F98 glioma-bearing rats and that OKN-007 decreased the levels of LBP. It was also found that LBP levels are highly expressed in human high-grade glioma tissues.  CONCLUSIONS LBP could potentially be used as a serum diagnostic marker of treatment response in high-grade gliomas. ",

    "abstract": "Background. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene that are frequently observed in low-grade glioma are strongly associated with the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which is a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of IDH1 mutant glioma. However, conventional MR spectroscopy (MRS) - based noninvasive detection of 2HG is challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine the additional value of other metabolites in predicting IDH1 mutations with conventional MRS.  Methods. Forty-seven patients with glioma underwent conventional single voxel short echo time MRS prior to surgery. A stereotactic navigation-guided operation was performed to resect tumor tissues in the center of the MRS voxel. MRS-based measurements of metabolites were validated with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also conducted integrated analyses of glioma cell lines and clinical samples to examine the other metabolite levels and molecular findings in IDH1 mutant gliomas.  Results. A metabolomic analysis demonstrated higher levels of 2HG in IDH1 mutant glioma cells and surgical tissues. Interestingly, glutamate levels were significantly decreased in IDH1 mutant gliomas. Through an analysis of metabolic enzyme genes in glutamine pathways, it was shown that the expressions of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 were reduced and glutamate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in IDH1 mutant gliomas. Conventional MRS detection of glutamate and 2HG resulted in a high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 72%, specificity 96%) for IDH1 mutant glioma.  Conclusions. IDH1 mutations alter glutamate metabolism. Combining glutamate levels optimizes the 2HG-based monitoring of IDH1 mutations via MRS and represents a reliable clinical application for diagnosing IDH1 mutant gliomas. ",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNA expression can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for human cancers. We report that the expression level of miR-182 was markedly up-regulated in glioma cell lines and in human primary glioma specimens. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that miR-182 was significantly increased by up to 32-fold in glioma tumors compared with the adjacent nontumor brain tissues obtained from the same patient. Elevated expression of miR-182 was further identified by in situ hybridization in 248 of 253 (98%) archived human glioma biopsies tested. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between miR-182 expression and World Health Organization glioma grading (P < 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rate of glioma patients was 51.54% (95% confidence interval, 0.435 to 0.596) in the low miR-182-expression group, whereas it was only 7.23% (95% confidence interval, 0.027 to 0.118) in the high miR-182-expression group (P < 0.001), and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-182 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of glioma patients. Moreover, the correlations of miR-182 level with the clinical features of glioma suggested in the in situ hybridization analysis were further verified by the real-time RT-PCR analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-182 could be a valuable marker of glioma progression and that high miR-182 expression is associated with poor overall survival in patients with malignant glioma.",

Here, we developed a new technique  to detect the IDH1R132H mutation in the plasma of patients with glioma.  Methods: Small-size DNA (150-250 base pairs) was extracted from the plasma of 31 controls  and 80 patients with glioma with known IDH1R132H status and correlated with MRI data. The  IDH1R132H mutation was detected by a combination of coamplification at lower denaturation  temperature and digital PCR.  Results: The small size DNA concentration was 1.2 ng/mL (range 0.1-6.6) in controls vs 1.2  ng/mL (range 0.1-50.3) in patients with glioma (p  not significant) and 0.9 ng/mL (0.0-3.0) in  low-grade gliomas vs 1.5 ng/mL in high-grade gliomas (p  0.01). The small size DNA concentra tion correlated with enhancing tumor volume (1.6 ng/mL [0.4-24.9] when 10 cm3 and 14.0  ng/mL [0.6-50.3] when 10 cm3). The IDH1R132H mutation was detected in 15 out of 25 plasma  DNA mixtures (60%) from patients with mutated tumors and in none of the 14 patients with a  nonmutated tumor. The sensitivity increased with enhancing tumor volume (3/9 in nonenhancing  tumors, 6/10 for enhancing volume 10 cm3, and 6/6 for enhancing volume 10 cm3).  Conclusion: With a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity related to the tumor volume and contrast  enhancement, IDH1R132H identification has a valuable diagnostic accuracy in patients not ame nable to biopsy.",

Identifification of these tumors however may have  therapeutic consequences. The purpose of this study was to characterize and identify oligodendrogliomas by their  metabolic profifile as measured by 1 H MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Fifteen patients with oligodendroglial  tumors (eight high-grade oligodendrogliomas, seven low-grade oligodendrogliomas) underwent MRI and short echo  time 1 H MRSI examinations. Five main metabolites found in brain MR spectra were quantifified and expressed as ratios  of tumor to contralateral white matter tissue. The level of lipids plus lactate was also assessed in the tumor. For  comparison six patients with a low grade astrocytoma were also included in the study. The metabolic profifile of  oligodendrogliomas showed a decreased level of N-acetylaspartate and increased levels of choline-containing  compounds and glutamine plus glutamate compared with white matter. The level of glutamine plus glutamate was  signifificantly higher in low-grade oligodendrogliomas than in low-grade astrocytomas and may serve as a metabolic  marker in diagnosis and treatment planning. In high-grade oligodendrogliomas large resonances of lipids plus lactate  were observed in contrast to low-grade tumors. ",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to be dysregulated and have pivotal roles in various human malignancies, including glioma. Previous studies revealed that metallothionein 1J (MT1JP) has important regulatory functions in the development of gastric cancer. However, the biological role and potential mechanism of MT1JP in glioma remain unknown. The present study suggested that MT1JP expression was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and glioma cell lines, and the decreased expression of MT1JP was associated with glioma progression and poor survival of patients with glioma. Additionally, overexpression of MT1JP significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Furthermore, it was revealed that MT1JP interacted with microRNA-24 (miR-24), which has previously been reported as an oncogene in glioma, negatively regulating its expression level. Rescue experiments revealed that the tumor suppressive functions of MT1JP may be mediated by the negative regulation of miR-24. Collectively, the data suggested that MT1JP inhibited the progression of glioma by negatively regulating miR-24 and may serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma.",

In this study we investigated Bcl-6 translocation and its transcriptional and translational levels in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cere- bral tissue sections from glioblastoma (GBM), low-grade glioma (Astrocytoma grade II and III), and meningioma patients, and correlated them with apoptotic processes and p53 and caspase-3 expression. The results showed a frequency of 36.6% of Bcl-6 translocation in GBM patients and a decreased expression in low-grade glioma patients, correlated with the severity of the disease. Bcl-6 translocation induced an overexpression of both Bcl-6 protein and messenger in GBM, inhibiting apoptotic processes and caspases 3 expression. On the contrary, in low-grade gliomas and meningiomas Bcl-6 expression was reduced, resulting in an increase of apoptotic processes. Finally, p53 expression levels in brain tumors were comparable to Bcl-6 levels. Overall, these data demonstrate, for the first time, that the Bcl-6 gene translocates in GBM patients and that its translocation and expression are correlated with apoptosis inhibition, indicating a key role for this gene in the control of cellular proliferation.

To determine whether the upregulation of miR-221 could be associated with tumor development or progression, a synthetic miR-221 mimic was transiently transfected into U251 astrocytoma cells in vitro. qRT-PCR confirmed that the mimic significantly increased the expression of miR-221 in these cells. An MTT colorimetric assay indicated that proliferation was significantly higher in U251 cells transfected with miR-221 mimic than in scramble-transfected control cells (P<0.05). Further analysis of miR-221 transfected cells by flow cytometry revealed an altered cell cycle progression, with more cells in S and G1 phase, as well as an inhibition of apoptosis (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the upregulation of miR-221 in astrocytoma tissues may be associated with development or progression of these tumors.

    "abstract": "Objective: Scholars have gradually come to appreciate the relevance of serine and glycine metabolism. Recently, researchers have discovered that mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) is overexpressed in various types of cancer. However, the function of SHMT2 in glioma is not clear. In this study, we sought to examine the expression of SHMT2 in glioma, the association between SHMT2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics, and the association of SHMT2 expression with prognosis in glioma patients. Methods: We evaluated the expression of SHMT2, Ki67, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and Glutathione S Transferase pi (GST-pi) in 150 glioma patients using immunohistochemistry assays. The associations among the expression of SHMT2, clinicopathological parameters, and outcome of glioma patients were statistically analysed. Results: The expression of SHMT2 was increased in gliomas compared to normal brain tissue and gradually increased with increasing WHO grade. The SHMT2 expression was positively correlated with Ki67 expression and WHO degree (p < 0.01) but was not correlated with other clinicopathological parameters, including sex, age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), tumour diameter, MGMT, and GST-pi (p >0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analyses showed that SHMT2 expression and the WHO grade were independent prognostic indicators for glioma patients. Conclusion: The expression of SHMT2 in glioma was signifificantly increased compared to normal brain tissue. SHMT2 promoted tumour proliferation, and there was no association between SHMT2 and drug resistance mechanisms of glioma. SHMT2 may be a novel and valuable biomarker for the diagnosis of glioma and an independent prognostic parameter of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Background: Studies have revealed the aberrant expression of lncRNAs is responsible for human carcinogenesis.MIR4697 host gene (MIR4697HG) is an upregulated lncRNA that promoted cell growth and metastasis in other cancers. In this study, we tested the expression of MIR4697HG in glioma cells and detected the comparatively down-regulated expression. RAD1 is an upstream regulator for MIR4697HG. This study aimed at exploring the regulatory mechanism and function of RAD1/MIR4697HG/PRR12 axis in glioma. Methods: We profiled the expression of MIR4697HG in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues according to GEPIA database as well as in glioma cells by qPCR. Functional experiments confirmed relevant role of MIR4697HG in regulating glioma cell proliferation and migration. We also carried out luciferase reporter assay,pull down assay and RIP assay to verify the location and interaction among the indicated RNA molecules. Results: The expression of MIR4697HG is down-regulated significantly in glioma cells due to the up-regulated expression of RAD21. MiR-766-5p was identified functioning as a sponge for MIR4697HG and is sequestered by MIR4697HG. We also found either miR-766-5p inhibitor or PRR12 knockdown rescued the function depletion caused by MIR4697HG overexpression. In all, the down-regulated expression of MIR4697HG inhibited PRR12 to suppress glioma and led to the deterioration of glioma. Conclusion: RAD21-induced down-regulated expression of MIR4697HG is correlated with aggravation of glioma.The MIR4697HG/miR-766-5p/PRR12 axis predicts poor results in glioma and MIR4697HG could be considered as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and treatment of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas remain a major public health challenge, posing a high risk for brain tumor-related morbidity and mortality.  However, the mechanisms that drive the development of gliomas remain largely unknown. Emerging evidence has shown  that long noncoding RNAs are key factors in glioma pathogenesis. qRT-PCR analysis was used to assess the expression of  FTX and miR-342-3p in the different stages of gliomas in tissues. Bioinformatics tool DIANA and TargetSCan were used  to predict the targets of FTX and miR-342-3p, respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to test the  correlation between the expression levels of FTX, miR-342-3p, and astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). To examine the  role of FTX in regulating proliferation and invasion of glioma cells, specific siRNA was used to knockdown FTX, and MTT  (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and transwell assays were performed. Furthermore, rescue  experiments were performed to further confirm the regulation of miR-342-3p by FTX. We then found that the expression  of FTX and miR-342-3p was associated with progression of gliomas. FTX directly inhibited the expression of miR-342-3p,  which subsequently regulates the expression of AEG-1. Collectively, FTX is critical for proliferation and invasion of glioma  cells by regulating miR-342-3p and AEG-1. Our findings indicate that FTX and miR-342-3p may serve as a biomarker of  glioma diagnosis, and offer potential novel therapeutic targets of treatment of gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Background Recent studies have discovered that nuclear translocation of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor fragments function differently from the traditional model. This study aimed to uncover the nuclear expression of NGF in astrocytoma and its biological significance. Methods Ninety-four paraffin-embedded astrocytoma specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) and hemotoxylin & eosin (HE) staining. Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens and intraoperative snap-frozen astrocytoma tissues were assayed for NGF expression by ELISA and Western blotting. The outcome of patients who contributed samples was tracked. Each ten tissue samples from patients with traumatic brain injury who had received decompression surgery and CSF samples from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia but with no history of nervous system disease were taken as control. Results NGF-positive immunoreactive products were distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of astrocytoma, but were only located in the cytoplasm of traumatic brain injury (TBI) tissue. NGF nuclear-positive rate (NPR) of grades III-IV astrocytomas (70.0%) was higher than that of grades I-II astrocytoma (28.6%, P <0.05). NGF-NP expression positively correlated with the NGF concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (r=0.755, P <0.01). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the median survival time was 25 months for NGF-NP astrocytoma grade I-II patients and 42 months in NGF nuclear negative (NGF-NN) astrocytoma grade I-II patients (P <0.05). In astrocytoma III-IV patients, the median survival was 7 months for NGF-NP patients and 24 months for NGF-NN patients (P <0.01). Two types of NGF with molecular weights of 13 and 36 kDa were present in astrocytoma, but only the 36 kDa NGF was found in the CSF. NGF expression elevated as the malignancy increased. Conclusions NGF-NP expression and NGF level in CSF were significant prognostic factors in astrocytoma patients.

    "abstract": "Background There is no validated blood biomarker available for glioma management. Invasive growth is the key feature of glioma. We assessed the clinical usefulness of plasma tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), which has less molecular weight than metalloproteinases, as a potential blood biomarker for glioma. Methods A total of 285 patients and 59 normal subjects were studied. Plasma concentration of TIMP-1 was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma TIMP-1 was compared between normal and glioma patients, between patients with different pathological grades, and between patients with different prognoses. Longitudinal changes in plasma TIMP-1 during treatment were also evaluated. Plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 level was also assayed and its clinical usefulness was compared with that of TIMP-1.  Results Plasma TIMP-1 and MMP-9 were both increased in glioma patients compared with normal controls (TIMP-1: P <0.001; MMP-9: P=0.007). Plasma TIMP-1 increases with increased tumor grade. In Grade IV gliomas, plasma TIMP-1 significantly increased after \"successful removal\" of the tumor (paired samples t-test, before operation vs. during chemotherapy without recurrence, t = -2.131, P=0.038), but did not change significantly at the time of tumor recurrence (during chemotherapy without recurrence vs. after tumor recurrence, t = -0.652, P=0.632). High plasma TIMP-1 level correlated with better survival in Grade IV glioma patients (hazard ratio: 0.550, 95% CI: 0.101-1.000, P=0.036). In Grade IV gliomas, patients with higher plasma TIMP-1 had significantly longer survival time than those with lower plasma TIMP-1 level (25.23 vs. 18.95 months, log-rank P=0.045). Plasma MMP-9 did not show significant association with either the pathological grade or the prognosis of glioma patients.  Conclusions Plasma TIMP-1 is associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma patients. It appears to have better usefulness for guiding clinical decision making than plasma MMP-9. Further studies in an expanded patient population are needed to better define its clinical usefulness. ",

The present study examined the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum exosomal-(exo-)miR-210 levels in association with hypoxic conditions in patients with glioma. Serum levels of exo-miR-210 were determined by quantitative PCR in samples obtained from patients with glioma. Patients were divided into low-and high-expression exo-miR-210 groups according to the median expression value. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the potential value of exo-miR-210 in predicting the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with glioma. A significantincrease in serum exo-miR-210 levels was observed in patients with glioma compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the expression levels of exo-miR-210 were increased with ascending pathological grades. Furthermore, expression levels of miR-210 in serum exosomes from patients with glioblastoma were markedly decreased following surgery and upregulated once more at the recurrences of primary tumors, indicating that exo-miR-210 could reflect alterations in malignant gliomaloads. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to analyze overall survival (OS) time. Patients with malignant glioma with high exo-miR-210 expression exhibited a poorer OS compared with patients with low expression. Importantly, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the expression levels of exo-miR-210 in glioma serum samples were independently associated with OS. Finally, increased serum exo-miR-210 expression was positively associated with high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a and reflected hypoxia in patients with glioma. In conclusion, serumlevels of exo-miR-210 may serve as a diagnostic, prognostic and hypoxic biomarker to reflect glioma status and hypoxisignatures.",

Results revealed that miR-128 expression was signifificantly decreased in glioma preoperative serum compared with normal controls and meningioma serum samples (both P< 0.001). ROC analyses showed that serum miR-128 levels were reliable in distinguishing patients with glioma from normal controls and meningioma, with the area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.9095 and 0.8283, respectively. In addition, the AUC value for discriminating glioma II-IV from I was 0.7362. Importantly, serum miR-128 expression was signifificantly elevated after surgery (P < 0.001), although it didn't reach to normal levels (P < 0.001). Furthermore, low miR-128 levels in serum and tissue were markedly correlated with high pathological grade and low Karnofsky Performance Status score (KPS). These fifindings proved that serum miR-128 could be a sensitive and specific biomarker of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Background. Identifying the early genetic drivers can help diagnose glioma tumours in their early stages, before becoming malignant. However, there is emerging evidence that disturbance of epigenetic mechanisms also contributes to cell's malignant transformation and cancer progression. Long non-coding RNAs are one of key epigenetic modulators of signalling pathways, since gene expression regulation is one of their canonical mechanisms. The aim of our study was to search new gliomagenesis-specific candidate lncRNAs involved in epigenetic regulation. Patients and methods. We used a microarray approach to detect expression profiles of epigenetically involved lncRNAs on a set of 12 glioma samples, and selected LOC285758 for further qPCR expression validation on 157 glioma samples of different subtypes. To establish if change in expression is a consequence of epigenetic alterations we determined methylation status of lncRNA's promoter using MS-HRM. Additionally, we used the MLPA analysis for determining the status of known glioma biomarkers and used them for association analyses. Results. In all glioma subtypes levels of LOC285758 were significantly higher in comparison to normal brain reference RNA, and expression was inversely associated with promoter methylation. Expression substantially differs between astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, and is elevated in higher WHO grades, which also showed loss of methylation. Conclusions. Our study revealed that lncRNA LOC285758 changed expression in glioma is methylation-dependent and methylation correlates with WHO malignancy grade. Methylation is also distinctive between astrocytoma I-III and other glioma subtypes and may thus serve as an additional biomarker in glioma diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Object. Accurate discrimination between tumor and normal tissue is crucial for optimal tumor resection. Qualitative fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), synthesized endogenously following d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)  administration, has been used for this purpose in high-grade glioma (HGG). The authors show that diagnostically  significant but visually imperceptible concentrations of PpIX can be quantitatively measured in vivo and used to  discriminate normal from neoplastic brain tissue across a range of tumor histologies.  Methods. The authors studied 14 patients with diagnoses of low-grade glioma (LGG), HGG, meningioma, and  metastasis under an institutional review board-approved protocol for fluorescence-guided resection. The primary aim  of the study was to compare the diagnostic capabilities of a highly sensitive, spectrally resolved quantitative fluorescence approach to conventional fluorescence imaging for detection of neoplastic tissue in vivo.  Results. A significant difference in the quantitative measurements of PpIX concentration occurred in all tumor  groups compared with normal brain tissue. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of PpIX concentration as a diagnostic variable for detection of neoplastic tissue yielded a classification efficiency of 87% (AUC =  0.95, specificity = 92%, sensitivity = 84%) compared with 66% (AUC = 0.73, specificity = 100%, sensitivity = 47%)  for conventional fluorescence imaging (p < 0.0001). More than 81% (57 of 70) of the quantitative fluorescence measurements that were below the threshold of the surgeon's visual perception were classified correctly in an analysis  of all tumors.  Conclusions. These findings are clinically profound because they demonstrate that ALA-induced PpIX is a  targeting biomarker for a variety of intracranial tumors beyond HGGs. This study is the first to measure quantitative  ALA-induced PpIX concentrations in vivo, and the results have broad implications for guidance during resection of  intracranial tumors. ",

To identify patients who could beneft from  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies, we introduce lipid-encapsulated SPIO nanoparticles and  hypothesized that anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab conjugated of such nanoparticles can be used to identify EGFR positive glioblastomas in non-invasive T 2 MR image assays. The newly introduced lipid-coated SPIOs, which imitate  biological cell surface and thus inherited innate nonfouling property, were utilized to reduce nonspecifc binding to  of-targeted cells and prevent agglomeration that commonly occurs in nanoparticles.  Results: The synthesized targeted EGFR-antibody-conjugated SPIO (EGFR-SPIO) nanoparticles were characterized  using dynamic light scattering, zeta potential assays, gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays, transmission electron  microscopy (TEM) images, and cell line afnity assays, and the results showed that the conjugation was successful.  The targeting efciency of the synthesized EGFR-SPIO nanoparticles was confrmed through Prussian blue stain-  ing and TEM images by using glioblastoma cell lines with high or low EGFR expression levels. The EGFR-SPIO nano-  particles preferentially targeted U-251 cells, which have high EGFR expression, and were internalized by cells in a  prolonged incubation condition. Moreover, the T2 MR relaxation time of EGFR-SPIO nanoparticles could be used for  successfully identifying glioblastoma cells with elevated EGFR expression in vitro and distinguishing U-251 cells from  U-87MG cells, which have low EFGR expression.

However, the potential clinical significance of serum miR-100 in GBM remained unknown. OBJECTIVE We aimed to detect the expression level of serum miR-100 in patients with GBM and assess its potential diagnostic and prognostic value. METHODS Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to measure serum miR-100 levels in 95 GBM patients and 60 healthy volunteers. The association between serum miR-100 level and clinicopathological parameters as well survival of GBM patients was evaluated. RESULTS Our results revealed that serum miR-100 levels were significantly decreased in GBM patients compared with the healthy controls. Additionally, miR-100 levels were significantly elevated after treatment. Low miR-100 expression was closely correlated with worse clinicopathological characteristics. Further receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that serum miR-100 could effectively discriminate GBM cases from normal controls. Moreover, survival analyses revealed that patients with high serum miR-100 levels had significantly longer survival time than those with low serum miR-100 levels.

We profiled724 cancer-associated proteins in sera of healthy individuals (n=27) and GBM (n=28) using antibody microarray. While 69 proteins exhibited differential abundance in GBM sera, a three-marker panel (LYAM1, BHE40 and CRP) could discriminate GBM sera from that of healthy donors with an accuracy of 89.7% and p<0.0001. The high abundance of C-reactive protein(CRP) in GBM sera was confirmed in 264 independent samples. High level of CRP protein was seen in GBM but without a change in transcript levels suggesting a non-tumoral origin. Glioma-secreted Interleukin 6 (IL6) was found to induce hepatocytes to secrete CRP, involving JAK-STAT pathway. The culture supernatant from CRP-treated microglial cells induced endothelial cell survival under nutrient-deprivation involving CRP-FcγRIII signaling cascade. Transcript profiling of CRP-treated microglial cells identified Interleukin 1β(IL1β) present in the microglial secretome as the key mediator of CRP-induced endothelial cell survival. IL1β neutralization by antibody-binding or siRNA-mediated silencing in microglial cells reduced the ability of the supernatant from CRP-treated microglial cells to induce endothelial cell survival. Thus our study identifies a serum based three-marker panel for GBM diagnosis and provides leads for developing targeted therapies.",

Arteriolar cerebral blood volume (CBVa) obtained from iVASO MRI is hypothe sized to be an indicator of tumor microvasculature.  Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of iVASO MRI implemented at 3T in predicting histologic grades of cerebral  gliomas.  Study Type: Retrospective.  Subjects: Forty-fifive patients (31 males) consisting of 14 WHO grade IV glioblastoma multiformes, 14 grade III, and 17 grade II  gliomas.  Field Strength/Sequence: At 3T we acquired CBVa data using an iVASO sequence.  Assessment: The maximum and mean CBVa (CBVa_max and CBVa_mean) values were calculated in the tumor and normal ized to the contralateral thalamus (nCBVa_max and nCBVa_mean).  Statistical Tests: Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were used for  statistical analysis.  Results: Both CBVa_max and nCBVa_max increased with tumor grade (P < 0.001). Grade II gliomas showed CBVa_max <0.78 ml /  100 ml in 10/17 cases and nCBVa_max <1.20 in 11/17 cases. Grade III gliomas showed both CBVa_max >0.78 ml / 100 ml and  nCBVa_max >1.20 in 13/14 cases, and CBVa_max <2.06 ml / 100 ml in 13/14 cases and nCBVa_max <2.33 in 11/14 cases.

Methods: MGMT expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining in 72 cases of GBM which had been  classified as three molecular subtypes. The relationship between MGMT and P53, an important molecule for identification of proneural-like GBM, were further analyzed. The association between MGMT and patients' prognosis was  analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method, which was further validated by the data from 513 cases of GBM in the TCGA  database. Results: MGMT expression was lower in proneural-like subtype in 72 GBM cases (p < 0.001), and was  negatively correlated with P53 (r=-0. 6203, p < 0.001). This results was also verified by a validation group of 87  GBM cases (r=-0. 2950, p < 0.001). Interestingly, low expression of MGMT predicted a better outcome in proneurallike subtype or P53 high-expression group (p < 0.05) but not in non-proneural-like subtype and P53 low-expression  group. All of these results were verified by the data from TCGA database.

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests the crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cancers. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical and functional roles of miR-769-3p in glioma, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of miR-769-3p in glioma tissues and cells. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to calculate the diagnostic value of miR-769-3p. The 5-year survival rate of patients was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis. Cell experiments were used to investigate the functional role of miR-769-3p in glioma. The gene target of miR-769-3p was predicted by TargetScan. Changes in the levels of Wnt signaling-related proteins were measured by western blotting. miR‐769‐3p was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and serum, as well as in glioma cell lines (P<0.001). miR-769-3p expression was significantly associated with the World Health Organization grade and Karnofsky performance score. The ROC curves demonstrated that serum miR-769-3p level reliably distinguished patients with glioma from healthy individuals. High tissue miR-769-3p expression predicted poor overall survival in patients with glioma (log‐rank P=0.001) and was identified as an independent prognostic factor. In addition, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-769-3p in glioma cells using a luciferase assay. miR-769-3p upregulation suppressed the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in glioma cells. In conclusion, miR-769-3p may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in patients with glioma and target ZEB2 to inhibit tumor progression via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. miR-769-3p may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.

    "abstract": "LRRC4 is not only a brain-specific gene, but it has also been identified as a tumor suppressor gene for glioma. Promoter methylation of LRRC4 is frequently involved in the inactivation in glioma. MiRNA-mediated gene regulation has recently been demonstrated to play an important role in multiple biological processes related to cancer, including glioma. In this study, we demonstrated that a small regulatory microRNA, hsa-miR-381, an \"oncomir\", had a major role in glioma progression and that LRRC4 was a target of hsa-miR-381. By regulating LRRC4, hsa-miR-381 increased the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of glioma cells, and this action was associated with decreased inhibition of MEK/ERK and AKT signaling. Conversely, LRRC4, as a glioma suppressor, inhibited the endogenous expression of hsa-miR-381 and decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth. The interaction of hsa-miR-381 and LRRC4 is involved in the pathogenesis of glioma. In addition, the stable expression of hsa-miR-381 in blood provides a novel and promising diagnostic biomarker, and anti-hsa-miR-381 \"antagomir\" may be an ideal target for glioma therapy ",

However, its role in gliomas and its exact molecular mechanism need further research. Methods and materials: RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate miR-129-5p and HOXC10 mRNA expression levels in tissues and cell lines. Cell proliferation was detected via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine(EdU) and clone formation assays. Luciferase assays were used to validate the binding of seeds between miR-129-5p and HOXC10. A tumor xenograft model was developed to study the effect of miR‐129-5p on glioma growth in vivo. Results: miR-129-5p was expressed at low levels in glioma tissues and cell lines. miR-129-5p overexpression inhibited glioma proliferation, migration and invasion. miR-129-5p negatively and directly targeted HOXC10. At the same time, HOXC10 was upregulated in glioma cancer, and HOXC10 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation,migration and invasion. Conclusion: miR-129-5p inhibits glioma development by altering HOXC10 expression and may therefore serve as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma in the future.",

    "abstract": "Purpose and Experimental Design: In modern neurooncology, no variable affects therapeutic decisions and prognostic estimation more than tumor classification. We showed recently that class prediction models, based on gene expression profiles, classify diagnostically challenging malignant gliomas in a manner that better correlates with clinical outcome than standard pathology. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate YKL-40 protein expression in independent sets of glioblastomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas to determine whether this single marker can aid classification of these high-grade gliomas. Results and Conclusions: Glioblastomas show strikinglymore YKL-40 expression than anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Only 2 of 37 glioblastomas showed completely negative YKL-40 staining in both tumor cells and extracellular matrix, whereas 18 of 29 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were completely negative in non-microgemistocytic tumor cells and extracellular matrix. Tumor cell staining intensity was also markedly different: 84% of glioblastomas showed strong staining intensities of 2+ or 3+ whereas 76% of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas either did not stain or stained at only 1+. YKL-40 staining provided a better class distinction of glioblastoma versus anaplastic oligodendroglioma than glial fibrillary acidic protein, the current standard immunohistochemical marker used to distinguish diagnostically challenging gliomas. Moreover, a combination of YKL-40 and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry afforded even greater diagnostic accuracy in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytic, oligodendroglial and mixed gliomas are the commonest gliomas in adults. They have distinct phenotypes and clinical courses, but as they exist as a continuous histological spectrum, differentiating them can be difficult. Co-deletions of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated 108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P ¼ 0.005). In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified. No somatic mutations were found among the five genes located in the homozygously deleted region. However, the CpG island of TNFRSF9 was hypermethylated in 19% of astrocytic tumours and 87% of glioma cell lines. TNFRSF9 expression was upregulated after demethylation of glioma cell lines. Akt3 amplifications were found in four glioblastomas. Our results indicate that 1p deletions are common anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas but are distinct from the 1p abnormalities in oligodendrogliomas.",

    "description": "Classical astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumours have typical genotypes. Astrocytic tumours often show gains of chromosome 7 and/or deletions of chromosome 10, mutations of RB1 or PTEN as well as amplification of EGFR, CDK4 or MDM2, which are rare in oligodendroglial tumours. The great majority of oligodendrogliomas have hemizygous losses of all of 1p (total 1p deletion), almost always combined with losses of all of 19q (total 19q deletion) (Reifenberger and Louis, 2003; Ichimura et al., 2004). Recent prospective control trials show that loss of one entire copy of 1p and 19q is a favourable prognostic indicator in both anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (Cairncross et al., 2006; van den Bent et al., 2006). Attempts to find the gene(s) targeted by focusing on the smallest consistently deleted region found in a small subset of oligodendroglial tumours have been unsuccessful (Nigro et al., 2001; Iuchi et al., 2002; Hashimoto et al., 2003; Dong et al., 2004; Felsberg et al., 2004). Recent reports of an unbalanced t(1;19)(q10;p10) translocation as the mechanism of co-deletions of 1p/19q in oligodendrogliomas make such an approach less likely to be rewarding (Griffin et al., 2006; Jenkins et al., 2006).",

Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the  expression of MK and PTN proteins in 168 patients with gliomas. The levels of MK and PTN mRNA in  glioma tissues and paratumor tissues were evaluated in 45 paired cases by quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess prognostic  signifificance. The expression levels of MK and PTN proteins in glioma tissue were both signifificantly higher  (both p < 0.001) than those in paratumor tissues on immunohistochemistry analysis, which was  confifirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Additionally, the overexpression of either MK or PTN was signifificantly  associated with the World Health Organization Grade (p = 0.001 and 0.034, respectively), low Karnofsky  Performance Status (KPS) score (p = 0.022 and 0.001, respectively), time to recurrence (p = 0.043 and  0.011, respectively) and poor overall survival (p = 0.018 and 0.001, respectively).

Furthermore,  the co-expression of MK and PTN was more signifificantly (p = 0.003) associated with adverse prognosis  in patients with gliomas than the respective expression of MK or PTN alone.

Methods: The expression of AEG-1 in normal human oligodendroglial cells, oligodendroglioma cell line,and four pairs of matched oligodendroglioma tissues and their adjacent normal brain tissues was detected by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. In addition, AEG-1 protein expression was examined in 75 cases of histologically characterized oligodendrogliomas by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were applied to test for prognostic and diagnostic associations. Results: Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that AEG-1 mRNA and protein were elevated in the oligodendroglioma cell line and significantly upregulated in primary oligodendrogliomas compared with the adjacent non-cancerous brain tissues.

Statistical analysis suggested that upregulation of AEG-1 was significantly correlated with the histological gradeof oligodendroglioma (p = 0.000) and that patients with high AEG-1 level exhibited shorter survival time(p = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that AEG-1 upregulation might be an independent prognosticindicator for the survival of patients with oligodendroglioma.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor accounting for more than 54 % of all gliomas. Despite aggressive treatments, median survival remains less than 1 year. This might be due to the unavailability of effective molecular diagnostic markers and targeted therapy. Thus, it is essential to discover molecular mechanisms underlying disease by identifying dysregulated pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Notch signaling is one such pathway which plays an important role in determining cell fates. Since it is found to play a critical role in many cancers, we investigated the role of Notch genes in glioblastoma with an aim to identify biomarkers that can improve diagnosis. Using real-time PCR, we assessed the expression of Notch genes including receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4), ligands (JAG1, JAG2, and DLL3), downstream targets (HES1 and HEY2), regulator Deltex1 (DTX1), inhibitor NUMB along with transcriptional co-activator MAML1, and a component of gamma-secretase complex APH1A in 15 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient samples. Relative quantification was done by the 2ΔΔCt method; the data are presented as fold change in gene expression normalized to an internal control gene and relative to the calibrator. The data revealed aberrant expression of Notch genes in glioblastoma compared to normal brain. More than 85 % of samples showed high Notch1 (P= 0.0397) gene expression and low HES1 (P = 0.011) and DTX1 (P = 0.0001) gene expression. Our results clearly show aberrant expression of Notch genes in glioblastoma which can be used as putative biomarkers together with histopathological observation to improve diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, and patient prognosis.

Here, we showed that Par6 is an essential component in glioma tumorigenesis. Our results indicated the aberrant expression of Par6 in malignant glioma tissues and cell lines. We found that the regulation of Par6 expression induces cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed the effects of Par6 were associated with cyclin D1- regulated cell cycle progression in glioma cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that the regulation of Par6 can enhance the activation of Akt/PI3K signaling pathway, and subsequently upregulate the expression level of GSK-3β protein, which then regulate cyclin D1-mediated cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, we found that TGF-β-induced the upregulation of Par6 expression may be involved in this process. The pathological analysis confirmed the correlation between Par6 expression and the prognosis in human glioma tissues, suggesting the regulation of Par6 expression regulates glioma tumorigenesis and progression.

Under standing the mechanisms involved in glioma invasion could  lead to new therapeutic strategies. We have previously shown  that BEHAB/brevican, an extracellular matrix protein in the  central nervous system, plays a role in the invasive ability of  gliomas. The mechanisms that underlie BEHAB/brevican  function are not yet understood, due in part to the existence  of several isoforms that may have different functions. Here we  describe for the first time the expression of BEHAB/brevican  in human brain and characterize two novel glioma-specific  isoforms, B/bsia and B/b#g, which are generated by differen tial glycosylation and are absent from normal adult brain and  other neuropathologies. B/bsia  is an oversialylated isoform  expressed by about half the high- and low-grade gliomas  analyzed. B/b#g  lacks most of the carbohydrates typically  present on BEHAB/brevican and is the major up-regulated  isoform of this protein in high-grade gliomas but is absent in  a specific subset of low-grade, indolent oligodendrogliomas.  B/b#g is detected on the extracellular surface, where it binds  to the membrane by a mechanism distinct from the other  BEHAB/brevican isoforms. The glioma-specific expression of  B/b#g, its restricted membrane localization, and its expression in all high-grade gliomas tested to date suggest that it  may play a significant role in glioma progression and make  it an important new potential therapeutic target. In addition,  its absence from benign gliomas prompts its use as a diagnostic marker to distinguish primary brain tumors of similar  histology but different pathologic course.",

The aim of this study was to detect aberrant p16 promoter methylation as a potential diagnostic marker in the serum of patients with diffuse glioma to differentiate between gliomas and, particularly, to differentiate those in the brainstem from others; this was done by using the modified methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction technique. METHODS: The methylation- specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect p16 methylation in the DNA extracted from 20 astrocytic tumors and 20 oligodendroglial tumors and the corresponding serum samples. Serum samples from 10 healthy individuals were used as controls. The association of p16 hypermethylation in the serum DNA of glioma patients with clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. In addition, the serum DNA in 7 patients with a brainstem tumor (4 gliomas, 1 schwannoma, 1 cavernous angioma, and 1 ependymoma) was analyzed. RESULTS: We found p16 methylation in 12 (60%) of the 20 tissues with astrocytoma,but in only 1 of the tissues with oligodendroglioma. Similar methylations were detected in the serum of 9 (75%) of the 12 patients with aberrant methylation in the tumor tissues. No methylated p16 sequences were detected in the peripheral serum of the patients having tumors without these methylation changes or in the 10 healthy controls.Additionally, p16 promoter methylation in the serum was observed in all brainstemastrocytoma cases, but not in other cases.

Determination of MIC-1/GDF15 protein levels by ELISA in the CSF of a cohort of 94 patients with intracranial tumors including gliomas, meningioma and metastasis revealed significantly increased concentrations in glioblastoma patients (median, 229 pg/ml) when compared with control cohort of patients treated for non-neoplastic diseases (median below limit of detection of 156 pg/ml, p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). However, plasma MIC-1/GDF15 levels were not elevated in the matching plasma samples from these patients. Most interestingly, patients with glioblastoma and increased CSF MIC-1/GDF15 had a shorter survival (p 5 0.007,log-rank test).

    "abstract": "Introduction: The microRNA, miR-210, is frequently associated with hypoxia induction, and an increase in its levels is often correlated with poor prognosis in many solid tumours. The present study examines the levels of miR-210 in glioma tumours of multiple origins to determine if an association can be established with disease progression.  Material and methods: Tissue samples were acquired from normal brain tissue, oligodendroglial tumours and astrocytic tumours. The astrocytic tumours were further divided by grade: diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II), anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III), and glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). The expression of miR-210 was examined by realtime quantitative RT-PCR. The correlation of the expression of miR-210 and astrocytic tumour grade was analyzed by the Spearman correlation test. Results: MiR-210 presents a differential expression depending on the origin of the glioma. Oligodendroglial tumours exhibit a significantly reduced level of miR-210 as compared with normal brain tissue. In contrast, astrocytic tumours demonstrate significantly increased levels of miR-210. Furthermore, the expression of miR-210 is positively correlated with the grade of astrocytic tumour, in the following order: grade IV > grade III > grade II > normal brain tissue (p < 0.05). Conclusions: MiR-210 levels can be potentially established as a biomarker for pathological diagnosis of malignant astrocytic tumour progression. In addition, the expression of miR-210 can be utilized as an additional identification measure of glioma tumour origin.",

Here, in this study, we investigated the biological function and role of DIRAS3 in gliomas. and found thatDIRAS3 is up-regulated in gliomas and is positively correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients, meanwhile, over-expressed DIRAS3 promotes glioma cells proliferation and invasion. Further mechanistic study showed that the expression level of DIRAS3 in Classical and Mesenchymal subtype GBMs is higher, and over expression of DIRAS3 promotes EGFR-AKT signaling activation at the downstream ofEGFR and increases AKT phosphorylation, meanwhile suppression of AKT by MK 2206 reverses the tumor promoting function of DIRAS3. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel oncogenic role ofDIRAS3 in the development and progression of glioma, which suggest that DIRAS3 could serve as a potential diagnostic marker and a promising therapeutic target of gliomas.",

Therefore, the identification of CSC-specific cell surface markers is very important for the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies. We found that Nestin (a type VI intermediate filament protein), like the glioma stem cell (GSC) markers CD133 and CD15, exhibited different levels of expression in primary human glioblastoma specimens. Similar to our previous finding that cytoplasmic Nestin is expressed as a cell surface form in mouse GSCs, the cell surface form of Nestin was also expressed at different levels in human GSCs. We isolated cell surface Nestin-positive cell populations from human GSCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS analysis, and observed that these populations exhibited robust CSC properties, such as increased tumorsphere-forming ability and tumorsp here size. Mechanistically, we found that DAPT, a c-secretase (a multi-subunit protease complex) inhibitor, reduced the proportion of cell surface Nestin-positive cells in human GSCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, without significant changes in total Nestin expression, implying that a post-trans lational modification was involved in the generation of cell surface Nestin. Taken together, our data provides the first evidence that cell surface Nestin may serve as a promising GSC marker for the isolation and characterization of heterogeneous GSCs in glioblastomas. ",

This study focused on the identification of lncRNAs to identify targets for possible GBM prognosis. Microarray expression profiling found that 1,759 lncRNAs and 3,026 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were upregulated, and 1932s lncRNA and 2,979 mRNAs were downregulated in GBM. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification identified TCONS_00020456 (TCON) for further analysis. In situ hybridization, along with immunohistochemical and receiver operating characteristic analysis determined TCON (truncation value = 3.5) as highly sensitive and specific in GBM. Grade IV patients with glioma life span with different lncRNA staining scores were analyzed. TCON staining scores below 3.5 indicated poor prognosis (life span ranging from 0.25 to 7 months), even if the glioma was surgically removed. TCON decreased significantly in GBM, and showed a coexpressional relationship with Smad2 and protein kinase C α (PKCα). Overexpression of TCON reduced the proliferation on one hand and migration, invasion on the other. TCON also inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and glioma progression in vivo, based on a nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. In addition, we predicted a potential binding site and intersection that microRNAs targeting Smad2, PKCα, and TCON through RACE pretest and bioinformatics analysis. Taken together, TCON, regarded as oncosuppressor, targeting the Smad2/PKCα axis plays a novel role in inhibiting the malignant progression of glioma. Moreover, it also demonstrates that the level of TCON can be used as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for GBM.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a highly prevalent and aggressive form of primary brain tumor. It represents approximately 56% of all thenewly diagnosed gliomas. Macrophages are one of the major constituents of tumor-infltrating immune cells in the human gliomas. The role of immunosuppressive macrophages is very well documented in correlation with the poor prognosis of patients sufering from breast, prostate, bladder and cervical cancers. The current study highlights the correlation between the tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes and glioma progression. We observed an increase in the pool of M2 macrophages in high-grade gliomas, as confrmed by their CD68 and CD163 double-positive phenotype. In contrast, less M1 macrophages were noticed in high-grade gliomas, as evidenced by the down-regulation in the expression of CCL3 marker. In addition, we observed that higher gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 is associated with glioma progression. The Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicate that glioma patients with lower expression of M2c marker (CD163), and higher expression of M1 marker (CCL3) had better survival. Furthermore, we examined the systemic immune response in the peripheral blood and noted a predominance of M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and PD-1+ CD4 T cells in glioma patients. Thus, the study indicates a high gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 in high-grade gliomas as compared to low-grade gliomas and signifcantly elevated frequency of M2 macrophages and PD-1+ CD4 T cells in the blood of tumor patients.

    "abstract": "Purpose: To establish the frequency of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas at a population  level, and to assess whether they allow reliable discrimination between primary  (de novo) glioblastomas and secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade  or anaplasticastrocytoma.  Experimental Design: We screened glioblastomas from a population-based study for  IDH1 mutations and correlated them with clinical data and other genetic alterations.  Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 36 of 407 glioblastomas (8.8%). Glioblastoma  patients with IDH1 mutations were younger (mean, 47.9 years) than those with EGFR  amplification (60.9 years) and were associated with significantly longer survival (mean,  27.1 versus 11.3 months; P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations were frequent in glioblastomas  diagnosed as secondary (22 of 30; 73%), but rare in primary glioblastomas (14 of 377;  3.7%: P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations as genetic marker of secondary glioblastoma corre sponded to the respective clinical diagnosis in 95% of cases. Glioblastomas with IDH1  mutation diagnosed as primary had clinical and genetic profiles similar to those of sec ondary glioblastomas, suggesting that they may have rapidly progressed from a less  malignant precursor lesion that escaped clinical diagnosis and were thus misclassified  as primary. Conversely, glioblastomas without IDH1 mutations clinically diagnosed as  secondary typically developed from anaplastic rather than low-grade gliomas, suggest ing that at least some were actually primary glioblastomas, that may have been mis classified, possibly due to histologic sampling error.  Conclusion: IDH1 mutations are a strong predictor of a more favorable prognosis and  a highly selective molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas that complements  clinical criteria for distinguishing them from primary glioblastomas.

    "abstract": "Peptides that target cancer cell surface receptors are promising platforms to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic payloads speci cally to cancer but not normal tissue. IL13RA2 is a tumor-restricted receptor found to be present in several aggressive malignancies, including in the vast majority of high-grade gliomas and malignant melanoma. This receptor has been successfully targeted for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes using modi ed IL-13 ligand and more recently using a speci c peptide, Pep-1L. In the current work, we establish the in vitro and in vivo tumor binding properties of radiolabeled Pep-1L, designed for tumor imaging. We radiolabeled Pep-1L with Copper-64 and demonstrated speci c cell uptake in the IL13RA2-over expressing G48 glioblastoma cell line having abundant IL13RA2 expression. [64Cu]Pep-1L binding was blocked by unlabeled ligand, demonstrating speci city. To demonstrate in vivo tumor uptake, we intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice and demonstrated that [64Cu]Pep-1L speci cally bound tumors at 24 hours, which was signi cantly blocked (3-fold) by pre-injecting unlabeled peptide. To further demonstrate speci city of Pep-1L towards IL13RA2 in vivo, we exploited an IL13RA2-inducible melanoma tumor model that does not express receptor at baseline but expresses abundant receptor after treatment with doxycycline. We injected [64Cu]Pep-1L into mice bearing IL13RA2-inducible melanoma tumors and performed in vivo PET/CT and post-necropsy biodistribution studies and found that tumors that were induced to express IL13RA2 receptor by doxycycline pretreatment bound radiolabeled Pep-1L 3-4 fold greater than uninduced tumors, demonstrating receptor speci city. This work demonstrates that [64Cu]Pep-1L selectively binds hIL13RA2-expressing tumors and validates Pep-1L as an effective platform to deliver diagnostics and therapeutics to IL13RA2-expressing cancers.",

Our aim was to perform, for the fifirst time, a systematic and comparative analysis of NeuN expression in all major brain tumour subtypes to provide guidance for the rational  use of NeuN immunohistochemistry in diagnostic histopathology. Methods and results: Anti-NeuN immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffifin-embedded biopsy specimens of 106 diffuse astrocytomas, 100 pilocytic astrocytomas, 107 ependymomas, 59 1p-aberrant oligodendroglial neoplasms, 115 glioblastomas, 115 medulloblastomas,  14 gangliogliomas ⁄ gangliocytomas and 10 central neurocytomas. We found no NeuN expression in pilocytic astrocytoma, whereas all other investigated tumour subtypes showed focal or widespread expression in varying proportions of cases. Comparing NeuN  expression in clear cell tumours, widespread NeuN expression had a positive predictive value of 76.9% (95% confifidence interval 46.2, 95.0) for central neurocytoma. Lack of NeuN expression had a positive predictive value of 87.3% (76.5, 94.4) for oligodendro glioma.  Conclusions: Immunohistochemistry can detect NeuN expression in all major brain tumour subtypes except pilocytic astrocytoma. In the individual case, assessment of NeuN expression may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of clear cell primary brain  tumours but does not seem to be useful for the differential diagnosis of other brain tumour subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Cellular density is a parameter measured for glioma grade and invasiveness diagnosis. The characterization of the cellular density can be performed, non invasively, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), since, this technique displays a goodresolution. Nevertheless MRI sensitivity is critical. Development of smart contrast agents appears useful to increase MRIsignal to noise ratio (SNR). Tumor invasiveness is correlated with high expression of integrins that can be targeted by RGDmotif. In this study, MRI contrast agents or fluorescent probes linked to RGD-peptides were used, in a glioma model, to assess the relation between RGD uptake/signal improvement/cell density and consequently tumor invasiveness. Experiments were performed in vitro with U87-MG glioma cells. Flow cytometry and microscopy experiments with RGD and iRGDalexa488 demonstrated that cell internalization was dependent on cell density. The internalization involved a clathrindependent endocytosis. Cytoskeleton and particularly the microtubules were concerned. Actin filaments played a minor role. The internalization was also dependent on the glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylations. The cellular density modulated the importance of the endocytosis pathways and of the metabolism but not the cytoskeleton contribution. The internalization of the RGD-peptide associated to gadolinium chelate increased the SNR of U87 cells. Moreover, following the cell density augmentation, the SNR increased with a low amplitude but a trend was clearly determined. In conclusion, RGDpeptide internalization appeared, in vitro, as a marker of cellular density. In perspective, the combination of these peptides with contrast agents associated to more sensitive MRI techniques could improve the MRI signal allowing the characterization of cellular density for tumor diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are lethal primary intracranial tumors. To date, little information on the role of deregulated genes in gliomas have been identified. As the involvement of miRNAs in the carcinogenesis is well known, we carried out a pilot study to identify, as potential biomarkers, differentially ex-pressed microRNAs in blood samples of patients affected by glioma. We studied the miRNAs' expression, by means of microarray and Real-Time PCR, in 30 blood samples from glioma patients and in 82 blood samples of patients suffering from: (a) various neurological disorders (n=30), (b) primary B-lymphoma of the Central Nervous System (PCNSL, n=36) and (c) secondary brain metastases (n=16). By quantitative real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we identified significantly increased levels of two candidate biomarkers, miR-15b and miR-21, in blood of patients affected by gliomas. ROC analysis of miR-15b biomarker levels allowed to differentiate patients with tumour from patients without glioma. Furthermore, combined expression analyses of miR15b and miR-21 distinguished between patients with and without glioma (90% sensitivity and 100% specificity). In addition, a decrement in the expression levels of miR-16 characterized glioblastomas compared to low grade and anaplastic gliomas. In conclusion, this pilot study suggest that it's possible to identify the disease state by meaning miR-15b and miR-21 markers in blood, while miR-16 can be used to distinguish glioblastoma from other grade gliomas. They can potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of gliomas; further studies are mandatory to confirm our preliminary findings.",

In various malignant tumors, the role of HDGF in tumor progression and its use as a diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target have been extensively explored.However, the prognostic function and mitogenic role of HDGF in gliomagenesis are yet to be verified. In this study,we found a significant incidence of HDGF prevalence between the different pathological types and stages of glioma in 105 patients. We also found a prognostic significance in 41 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, with prevalence of nuclear HDGF predicting short survival of patients with GBM after surgery. To delineate the mitogenic role of HDGF in gliomagenesis, an adenoviral-expressed HDGF small interfering RNA (Ad-HDGF siRNA) was used to knock down expression of nuclear HDGF. After knocking down nuclear HDGF expression in human GBM cells, cell growth and cell invasion and induction on apoptosis by caspase-3 activation were significantly inhibited. We conclude that HDGF is a mitogenic growth factor in glioma progression and can be a useful prognostic marker for GBM and therapeutic target for clinical management of glioma in the future.",

    "abstract": "Caveolins are basic constituents of ﬂask-shaped cell membrane microdomains (caveolae), which are involved in many cell functions, including signalling, traﬃcking, and cellular growth control. The distribution of caveolae within the normal brain and in brain tumors is controversial. In the present study, we describe the expression of caveolin-1 (cav-1) in 64 brain tumors of diﬀerent grade, of either astroglial or oligodendroglial origin. All studied astrocitomas of any grade (from II to IV) were cav-1 positive, displaying staining patterns and intensity speciﬁcally associated to the diﬀerent tumor grades. In all glioblastomas and gliosarcomas, cav-1 staining was extremely intense, typically localized at the cell membrane and recognized a variable percentage of cells, including the majority of spindle cells and palisade-oriented perinecrotic cells. In anaplastic astrocytomas, a less intense membrane staining or a cytoplasmic dotlike immunoreactivity were present, the latter being almost the exclusive pattern observed in diﬀuse astrocitomas grade II. In contrast to astroglial tumors, the striking totality of grade II oligodendrogliomas and the large majority of grade III were lacking cav-1 expression. Interestingly, a cav-1 distribution overlapping the pattern described in tissues was observed also in primary cell cultures of human glioblastomas and astrocytomas, and also in one established glioblastoma cell line (U251 MG), analyzed by means of confocal microscopy and ﬂow cytometry. In conclusion, among astroglial tumors cav-1 expression varies in distribution, pattern, and intensity speciﬁcally according to tumor types and grades. The association between tumor progression and a more structured membranous pattern of cav-1 expression could suggest the hypothesis of a neoplastic shift towards a mesenchymal phenotype, whose behavioral and biologic signiﬁcance worth further studies. Finally, the lack of cav-1 immunoreactivity in oligodendrogliomas suggests its concrete application as a useful diagnostic marker.",

While long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)are clearly more abundant in human brain than protein-coding genes, the specific roles of lncRNAs and mechanisms underlying their dysregulation in glioma remain unclear. Here, we focused on lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in brain tumor and their potential biological functions. LOC441204, a novelnon-coding RNA gene displaying high expression in clinical specimens of brain tumor and significant upregulation in glioma cell lines in microarray analyses, was selected for further study. Notably, knockdown of LOC441204 suppressed tumor cell proliferation in two glioma cell lines. Moreover, LOC441204-induced tumor cell growth was mediated the stabilization of β-catenin pathway. Briefly,LOC441204 bound to β-catenin preventing its degradation, resulting in downstream p21 repression and cdk4 activation to enhance glioma cell proliferation.

By contrast,  INA was found in only 20% of cases with isolated/partial 1p aber rations and 36% of cases without 1p/19q deletions; it was also  found in 63% (10/16) of cases with isolated/partial 19q aberrations.  >-Internexin expression was more specifific in high-grade than in low grade gliomas (66% vs 31%).

Only no or weak INA expression was seen in  OMTs. In summary, INA is a useful marker to differentiate OTs from  astrocytic tumors and OMTs, but INA expression is not exclusively  linked to OTs harboring the 1p/19q codeletion. Moreover, it can  sometimes be heterogeneously distributed within tumors, which  emphasizes the need for 1p/19q analysis by molecular genetic tech niques for diagnosis.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of 1p/19q codeletion on cancer-cell  metabolism and evaluated possible metabolic targets for tailored therapies.Methods: We combined in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements in human  gliomas with the analysis of a series of standard amino acids by liquid chromatography-mass  spectroscopy (LC-MS) in human glioma biopsies. Sixty-five subjects with low-grade glioma were included  in the study: 31 underwent the MRI/MRS examination, 47 brain tumor tissue samples were analyzed with LC-MS, and 33 samples were analyzed for gene expression with quantitative polymerase chain  reaction (qPCR). Additionally, we performed metabolic tracer experiments in cell models with 1p  deletion.Results: We report the first in vivo detection of cystathionine by MRS in 1p/19q codeleted gliomas.  Selective accumulation of cystathionine was observed in codeleted gliomas in vivo, in brain tissue  samples, as well as in cells harboring heterozygous deletions for serine- and cystathionine-pathway  genes located on 1p: phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH).

In situ, embryonic stem cell factors were found also  in more differentiated tumor regions. Respective cells were  rarely actively proliferating and showed single or combined  expression signatures, which, at least in parts, corresponded to  observed positive correlations of mRNA expression.

This study showed that HOXB9 expression in glioma tissues was significantly higher than that in nontumor tissues. Higher HOXB9 expression was also significantly associated with advanced clinical stage in glioma patients. HOXB9 overexpression stimulated the proliferation, migration, and sphere formation of glioma cells, whereas HOXB9 knockdown elicited an opposite effect. HOXB9 overexpression also increased the tumorigenicity of glioma cells in vivo. Moreover, the activation of transforming growth factor-b1 contributed to HOXB9-induced oncogenic activities.

    "abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility of the previously described T2-FLAIR mismatch sign as a specific imaging marker in non- enhancing isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant, 1p/19q non-codeleted lower grade glioma (LGG), encompassing both diffuse and anaplastic astrocytoma. Methods: MR scans (n=154) from three separate databases with genotyped LGG were evaluated by two independent reviewers to assess (i) presence/absence of \"T2- FLAIR mismatch\" sign and (ii) presence/absence of homogenous signal on T2WI.Interrater agreement with Cohen's kappa (κ) was calculated, as well as diagnostic test  performance of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign to identify IDH-mutant astrocytoma. Results: There was substantial interrater agreement for the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign [κ = 0.75 (0.64, 0.87)], but only fair agreement for T2 homogeneity [κ = 0.38 (0.25- 0.52)]. The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign was present in 38 cases (25%) and had a positive predictive value of 100%, negative predictive value of 68%, a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusions: With a robust interrater agreement, our study confirms that among non- enhancing LGG the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign represents a highly specific imaging marker for IDH-mutant astrocytoma. This non-invasive marker may enable a more informed patient counsel and can aid in the treatment decision processes in a significant proportion of patients presenting with non-enhancing, LGG like lesions.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis to most  patients. Immunotherapy of GBM is a potentially beneficial treatment option, whose optimal  implementation may depend on familiarity with tumor specific antigens, presented as HLA  peptides by the GBM cells. Furthermore, early detection of GBM, such as by a routine blood test,  may improve survival, even with the current treatment modalities. This study includes large-scale  analyses of the HLA peptidome (immunopeptidome) of the plasma-soluble HLA molecules  (sHLA) of 142 plasma samples, and the membranal HLA of GBM tumors of 10 of these patients'  tumor samples. Tumor samples were fresh-frozen immediately after surgery and the plasma  samples were collected before, and at multiple visits after surgery. In total, this HLA peptidome  analysis involved 52 different HLA allotypes and resulted in the identification of more than 35,000  different HLA peptides. Strong correlations were observed in the signal intensities and in the  repertoires of identified peptides between the tumors and plasma-soluble HLA peptidomes of the  individual patients, while low correlations were observed between these HLA peptidomes and the  tumors' proteomes. HLA peptides derived from Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTAs) were selected  based on their presence among the HLA peptidomes of the patients and absence of expression of  their source genes from any healthy and essential human tissues, except from immune-privileged  sites. Additionally, peptides were selected as potential biomarkers if their levels in the plasma-sHLA peptidome were significantly reduced after the removal of tumor mass. The CTAs identified  among the analyzed HLA peptidomes provide new opportunities for personalized immunotherapy  and for early diagnosis of GBM.",

    "abstract": "Background: Malignant gliomas are the most common form of primary intracranial tumors with the highest mortality rates. Various gene alterations are considered as prognostic markers in glioma. But, the relevant molecular mechanisms in this setting are not well-understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the association and prognostic value of TLR9 and NFKBIA with clinical significance and also their impact on patient survival in human glioma. Methods: Expression of TLR9 and NFKBIA mRNA in the tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR methods. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to assess the association of TLR9 and NFKBIA with clinical outcomes of patients. Results: Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that TLR9 mRNAs is markedly expressed in glioma tissues than in non-neoplastic tissues (mean ± SD: 3.26 ± 0.40 vs. 0.71 ± 0.36, P <0.001). There was also a significant difference between TLR9 mRNAs and high grade glioma (P < 0.001).NFKBIA mRNAs was significantly identified in nonneoplastic tissues compared with glioma specimens (mean ± SD: 2.76 ± 0.30 vs. 0.94 ± 0.35, P <0.001). Lower levels of NFKBIA mRNA were significantly related to advanced grade of gliomas (P < 0.001). Furthermore, Immunoreactivity for high expression of TLR9 was detected in 65% of cases (26/40) that was associated with high grade glioma (P= 0.001, Table 1). No statistically significant correlation was found between TLR9 and other clinical parameters (Table1; P>0.05). Immunoreactivity for high expression of NFKBIA was observed in 32.5 % (13/40) of cases and NFKBIA expression was decreased in patients with high grad glioma (P = 0.014). There was no significant correlation between NFKBIA protein expression and age, sex, and relapse. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high expression of TLR9 and low expression of NFKBIA are significantly related to poorer OS (P<0.001). In addition , the multivariate Cox regression model revealed that TLR9 and NFKBIA protein expressions (low/ high) and tumor grade were potentially an independent predictor of survival in patients (hazard ratio, 2.132, 2.411, 2.13 [95% confidence interval, 1.825-3.782, 1.61-3.231, 1.542-3.92]; P = 0.012,P= 0.018, P=0.001).

    "abstract": " Background: Preoperative hematological markers that indicate nutritional, coagulation, and inflammation statuses have prognostic value for gliomas. This study aimed to investigate hematological markers with regard to tumor grades, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (IDH), age, and sex in patients with gliomas. Methods: From 2008 to 2017, patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioma who underwent surgery were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Information from clinical records, including age, sex, preoperative experiment tests (routine blood tests, biochemistry, and coagulation examinations), pathological results, and IDH status, was collected. A univariable survival analysis was performed. Hematological factors such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte-ratio (PLR), and albumin-to-globulin (AGR) were calculated. The prognostic nutrition index (PNI) was calculated as 10 × serum albumin value (g/dl) + 0.005 × peripheral lymphocyte count (per mm3 ). Results: Our study included 706 patients. The univariate analysis showed that age, IDH-1, and hematological factors were all significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in patients with gliomas. Our results showed that inflammation markers (NLR, PLR, and fibrinogen) were positively associated with age, whereas AGR was negatively associated with age. The PLR was significantly increased, whereas the AGR and PNI were decreased in women with gliomas, as compared with men. We found that inflammation markers increased and nutrition markers decreased with gliomas grade. However, these hematological markers did not significantly differ with IDH status. NLR was the best single hematological marker for distinguishing glioblastoma (GBM) [0.684 (0.645-0.723)], IDH-wt GBM [0.672 (0.631-0.71)] from other gliomas subtypes. Combinations of age with PNI and age with AGR were the best predictors of GBM [0.750 (0.713-0.786)] and IDH-wt GBM [0.759 (0.719-0.798)], respectively.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma differentials include intracranial tumors, like malignant lymphomas and metastatic brain  tumors with indiscernible radiological characteristics. The purpose of this study was to identify a distinct radiological  feature for the preoperative differentiation of glioblastoma from its differentials, which include malignant lymphomas and  metastatic brain tumors. METHODS Preoperative MR images, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies (b = 1000 and 4000 sec/mm2 ),  obtained in patients with newly diagnosed malignant tumor, were analyzed retrospectively after receiving approval from  the institutional review board. Sixty-four patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma, 32 patients with malignant  lymphoma, and 46 patients with brain metastases were included. The presence of a nonenhancing peritumoral DWI  high lesion (NePDHL, i.e., hyperintense lesion in a nonenhancing peritumoral area on DWI) was confirmed in both DWI  sequences. Gray matter lesions were excluded. Lesions were termed \"definite\" if present within 3 cm of the hyperintense tumor border with a signal intensity ratio  30% when compared with the contralateral normal white matter in both  sequences. Discriminant analysis between the histological diagnosis and the presence of Definite-NePDHL was performed, as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis incorporating the existence of Definite-NePDHL. RESULTS In 25% of glioblastoma patients, Definite-NePDHL was present, while it was conspicuously absent in patients  with malignant lymphoma and metastatic brain tumors. The specificity and positive predictive value were 100%. In the  glioblastoma subset, a higher preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score (p = 0.0028), high recursive partitioning  analysis class (p = 0.0006), and total surgical removal (p = 0.0012) were associated with better median overall survival.  Patients with Definite-NePDHL had significantly early local (p = 0.0467) and distant/dissemination recurrence (p <  0.0001) and poor prognosis (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS The presence of Definite-NePDHL is very specific for glioblastoma and indicates poor prognosis. Definite-NePDHL is a significant indicator of early local and distant/dissemination recurrence in patients with glioblastoma.

We developed a novel, non-invasive liquid chip assay to diagnose glioma and predict prognosis. Using this method, we determined the methylation state of the Alu element in cell-free DNA extracted from the serum of 109 glioma patients. Controls included 56 patients with benign intracranial tumors and 50 healthy subjects. Matched tumor tissues were processed for 36 patients. The cfDNA from glioma patients showed lower levels of Alu methylation than the controls (P<0.01). Alu methylation was also lower in high-grade than low-grade gliomas (P<0.01), indicating that Alu methylation correlates negatively with disease severity. Moreover, Alu methylation correlated positively with survival (P<0.01). These findings suggest high-throughput liquid chip could serve as a non-invasive diagnostic assay for glioma.",

Although there is data indicating that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-26 serves an important role in many human cancer types, its clinical significance in glioma remains uncertain. The present study aimed to evaluate MMP-26 expression in human astrocytic glioma specimens, and investigate its role and significance in the progression of astrocytic glioma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess MMP-26 expression in astrocytic glioma tissues. The levels of MMP-26 expression and its relevance to the clinicopathological features and prognostic factors in patients with astrocytic glioma patients were then investigated. The results demonstrated that MMP-26 expression was significantly assocaited with the World Health Organization grade (P<0.05). Additionally, it was identified that MMP-26 expression was an effective predictor of the overall survival of patients with astrocytic glioma (P<0.05). Analyses of univariate and multivariate Cox regression confirmed that MMP-26 expression was an independent factor for evaluating the prognosis of astrocytic glioma patients (P<0.05).

Ligand of Numb protein  X (LNX) is PDZ domain containing protein that interacts with cell fate determinant Numb. cDNA microarray analysis was used  to determine the expression of 13,939 genes in a set of 18 gliomas. It showed that human LNX was downregulated in 100% of  gliomas including low- and high-grade ones, which was confifirmed by Northern blot. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that  LNX was lowly expressed in cytoplasm of glioma cells. Thus, LNX might act as a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic  target for glioma. Two-hybrid screen in yeast was used to identify human LNX interacting proteins important for LNX function.  It showed that human LNX interacted with Ski interacting protein (SKIP) via PDZ domains. The co-immunoprecipitation results  suggested that LNX interacted with SKIP in HEK293 cells. LNX could affect the subcellular localization of Numb, which  indicated that LNX might function as a molecular anchor that localized Numb to the subcellular site of its interaction with  Notch. The presence of multiple protein binding domains involved in signal transduction and interaction with Numb and SKIP  suggested an important role for LNX in tumorogenesis.   2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Therefore, molecular oncology of GBM are urgently needed. In  this study, we performed an integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression to identify key  epigenetic genes in GBM. The methylation and gene expression of GBM patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas  (TCGA) database were downloaded. After data preprocessing, we identified 4,881 differentially expressed genes  (DEGs) between tumor and normal samples, including 1,111 upregulated and 3,770 downregulated genes. Then,  we randomly separated all samples into training set (n = 69) and testing set (n = 69). We next obtained 11,269  survival-methylation sites by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. In the correlation analysis, we  defined 198 low promoter methylation with high gene expression as epigenetically induced (EI) genes and 111  high promoter methylation with low gene expression as epigenetically suppressed (ES) genes. Key markers  including C1orf61 and FAM50B were selected with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.75. Further, we  chose the 20 CpG methylation sites of above two genes in unsupervised clustering analysis using the Euclidean  distance. We found that the prognosis of the hypomethylated group was significantly better than that in the  hypermethylated group (log-rank test p-value = 0.011). Based on the validation in the TCGA testing set and GEO  dataset, we validated the prognostic value of our signature (p-value = 0.02 in TCGA and 0.012 in GEO).

The current study was designed to investigate the relationship between serum vitronectin levels and clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis and prognosis in glioma patients. Methods: In a prospective observatory study, a total of 98 glioma patients, 98 healthy controls, 98 other non-glioma brain tumors, and 98 other non-tumor neurological diseases were recruited. Following univariate analyses, multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations of serum vitronectin levels with survival and clinicopathological parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was done to assess its diagnostic and prognostic predictive value. Results: Serum vitronectin levels were significantly elevated in glioma patients as compared with other groups. High Wealth Health Organization grade was independently associated with high vitronectin levels. Serum vitronectin levels could significantly distinguish glioma patients from other groups and discriminate highgrade glioma from low-grade glioma. Vitronectin levels markedly predicted 5-year progression and 5-year mortality. Moreover, serum vitronectin was identified as an independent predictor for 5-year overall survival and 5- year progression-free survival as well as 5-year mortality and 5-year progression.

    "abstract": " Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor, and there  is no effective treatment strategy. Patients with GBM have a median overall survival of only  14.6 months. Current treatment consists of safe and maximal surgical excision, followed by  concurrent chemoradiotherapy and maintenance chemotherapy. There are several obstacles that  hinder the effectiveness of this aggressive treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating  drug that acts through alkylating the O6  position of guanine in DNA that leads to cell death.  However, the expression and enzymatic activity of the DNA repair protein MGMT limits the  therapeutic benefit from treatment with TMZ. MGMT reduces the efficacy of alkylating drugs  by removing the methyl or alkyl group from damaged O6 -methylguanine. Expression levels of  MGMT play an important role in the outcome of GBM patients. miRNAs are a group of small  regulatory RNAs that control target gene expression by binding to mRNAs. miR-142-3p has  been found to be an important factor in the development and maintenance of the oncogenic state.",

Here, the authors evaluated serum miRNA 205  (miR-205) levels in patients with glioma. Methods Sixty-four patients in whom glioma was diagnosed and 45 healthy controls were recruited between October  2011 and March 2012 and randomly assigned to the screening cohort or the validation cohort. Cohorts of patients with  other brain tumors, including meningioma (n = 8), primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS (n = 6), and pituitary  adenoma (n = 5), were investigated and compared. miR-205 extraction from serum was detected by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to perform survival analysis,  the risk factors were analyzed by using a Cox regression model, and the receiver operating characteristic working curve  was used to analyze the value of miR-205 in the prognostic evaluation of the patients. Results The authors first demonstrated that serum miR-205 expression was significantly lower in patients with glioma  than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). It is important to note that serum miR-205 expression demonstrated a stepwise decrease with ascending pathological grades. The serum miR-205 biomarker had high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy  in patients with glioma. Serum levels of miR-205 were identified as an individual diagnostic marker and were significantly  lower in the glioma cohort than in the other brain tumor cohorts. Serum miR-205 levels were significantly increased in  postoperative samples over those in the preoperative samples and were reduced again during glioblastoma recurrences.  Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between low serum miR-205 expression and both ascending pathological grades (p = 0.002) and low Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (p = 0.01). Patients with glioma at an advanced  pathological grade (Grade III or IV) and a higher miR-205 serum level showed longer overall survival than those with a  lower miR-205 serum concentration (p < 0.01). Furthermore, Cox regression analysis revealed that miR-205 serum levels were independently associated with overall survival.

However, the potential role of serum miR-145-5p in the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) remains poorly known. This study was designed to explore the clinical significance of serum miR-145-5p in patients with GBM. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to measure the serum levels of miR-145-5p in 117 GBM patients, 52 grade I/II glioma patients and 50 healthy volunteers. The associations between serum miR-145-5p level and the clinical variables as well as prognosis were analyzed. The bioinformatic analysis of the downstream targets of miR-145-5p was also performed. Compared to grade I/II glioma patients and healthy controls, serum miR-145-5p levels were significantly decreased in GBM patients. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that serum miR-145-5p might be a reliable diagnostic marker of GBM with an AUC of 0.895, combing with 84.6% sensitivity and 78.0% specificity. Low serum miR-145-5p level had significant correlation with aggressive clinicopathological parameters. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that patients in the high serum miR-145-5p group survived significantly longer than those in the low serum miR-145-5p group. Multivariate analysis confirmed that serum miR-145-5p expression was an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival. The bioinformatic analysis revealed that many downstream genes and pathways that miR-145-5p regulated were closely associated with the initiation and development of cancer.

Here miR-210 was investigated as a potential serum biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma. Methods: Serum was immediately prepared from blood samples collected from patients with glioma grades I-IV at primary diagnosis (n ¼ 136) and healthy controls (n ¼ 50) from February 2007 to March 2014 in the Department of Neurosurgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Wuhu, China). Total RNA was isolated from serum. cDNA was synthesised with primers specific for miR-210 and miR-16-1 (internal control), and quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed. Results were statistically analysed to determine the role of miR-210 in the diagnosis and prognosis of human glioma patients. Results: An approximately seven-fold increase in miR-210 expression was detected in serum samples from glioblastoma patients relative to healthy controls. A threshold expression value (2.259) was chosen from receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC), and the low and high miR-210 expression groups were analysed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan- Meier analyses. Results revealed an association of high serum miR-210 expression with tumour grade and poor patient outcome (P-values o0.001).

We first investigated the expression level and prognostic power of SPAG4 in patients with GBM using The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort, and then SPAG4 knockdown by RNA interference was performed to reveal the effects of SPAG4 on GBM cells. mRNA and protein expression levels were determined by real-time PCR and western blot. MTT assay was used to examine cell proliferation, and a wound healing assay was performed to detect cell migration. SPAG4 was significantly overexpressed in patients with GBM, and high expression of SPAG4 was associated with a poor prognosis. Silencing of SPAG4 significantly suppressed the proliferation and migration of GBM cells. Meanwhile, decreased expression and phosphorylation of MEK and ERK were identified after SPAG4 knockdown, suggesting that SPAG4 might regulate GBM progression by activating MEK/ERK signaling pathway.

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that long noncoding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2) is frequently downregulated in several types of tumors and functions as a tumor-suppressive factor. However, the clinical significance and function of CASC2 in human glioma remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical values of CASC2, as well as investigate the potential molecular mechanisms in glioma.  Methods: This retrospective study first analyzed the expression levels of CASC2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Then, CASC2 expression levels were associated with various clinicopathologic characteristics and the survival rate of patients with glioma. Finally, the function and underlying molecular mechanisms of CASC2 in human glioma were investigated in U251 cell line. Results: By quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, our data showed that CASC2 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines (U87 and U251) compared to adjacent normal brain tissues or normal human astrocytes. Moreover, its expression negatively correlated with tumor grade in glioma patients. Furthermore, Kaplan- Meier curves with log-rank analysis revealed a close correlation between downregulated CASC2 and shorter survival time in glioma patients. In addition, Cox regression analysis indicated that CASC2 could be considered as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. Finally, in vitro experiment demonstrated that CASC2 overexpression remarkably suppressed glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Conclusion: This study suggested that CASC2 may potentially serve as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for glioma patients. ",

    "abstract": "Background: IL-13Ra2 is overexpressed by gliomas but not by normal tissue. However, the molecular basis for IL-  13Ra2 overexpression in gliomas is unknown.  Methods: In the present study we have investigated the regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for the expression of  IL-13Ra2 with mutation analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, Flow cytometry analysis, transcription factor binding assay and Elisa.  Results: Our results reveal a complex mechanism for regulating IL-13Ra2 expression that involves at least 2 promoters and  4 transcripts of human IL-13Ra2. Transcription factors NFAT and AP1 are necessary and essential for the expression of this  GBM related transcript, and are responsible for the high level of expression of IL-13Ra2 in GBM. Most interestingly, we found  that expression of this transcript results in the production of a secreted form of IL-13Ra2 and thus may have the potential to be  used as a diagnostic biomarker for GBM patients and other cancer patients that express the soluble form of this receptor.  Conclusion: This study is the fifirst to characterize the role of NFAT and AP1 in the regulation of IL-13Ra2 expression, and  provides insight into understanding the high levels of IL-13Ra2 expressed by GBM cells.

This study aims to examine if the analysis of OLIG2 and ID2 expression in glioma tissues helps the differential diagnosis of chemosensitive oligodendroglial tumors from astrocytic tumors. Expression levels of OLIG2 and ID2 in 11 oligodendroglial and 27 astrocytic tumors were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry. The mean expression level of OLIG2 was higher in oligodendroglial tumors than astrocytic tumors, but some astrocytic tumors showed high OLIG2 expression, indicating that OLIG2 cannot be an independent marker of oligodendroglial tumors. No significant difference was observed between ID2 expression in oligodendroglial tumors and astrocytic tumors. It was notable that OLIG2 expression was predominant over ID2 expression in oligodendroglial tumors, while ID2 expression was predominant over OLIG2 expression in astrocytic tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed that gliomas with loss on chromosome 1p, which is closely associated with chemosensitivity, also showed the predominant expression of OLIG2 over ID2. These results indicate that the immunohistochemical study on the relative expression level of OLIG2 to ID2 can be a useful screening for oligodendroglial tumors.",

    "abstract": "Tumor cells arising from a particular tissue may exhibit the same gene expression patterns as their precursor cells. To test this proposition, we have analyzed the expression of a neural RNA-binding protein, Musashi1, in primary human central nervous system (CNS) tumors. In rodents, Musashi1 is expressed predominantly in proliferating multipotent neural precursor cells, but not in newly generated postmitotic neurons. The expression of Musashi1 is downregulated with the successive progression of neurogenesis. In normal adult human tissues, we detected low levels of Musashi1 expression in brain and testis by RT-PCR analysis. In an RNA panel of 32 cancer tissues and cell lines, elevated expression of Musashi1 was seen in all five malignant gliomas studied, in contrast to the slight expression seen in other tumor cells, including those in several melanomas and a prostate cancer. Western blot analysis showed strong Musashi1 expression in malignant gliomas compared with nonneoplastic brain tissue. Glioblastomas, the most malignant form of glioma, showed higher Musashi1 expression than less malignant gliomas by immunohistochemical analysis. Tumors with strong Musashi1 expression tended to have high proliferative activity. Thus, the expression of Musashi1 correlated with the grade of the malignancy and proliferative activity in gliomas. These results suggest that primary CNS tumors may share gene expression patterns with primitive, undifferentiated CNS cells and that Musashi1 may be a useful marker for the diagnosis of CNS tumors.",

Further analysis of TCGA and GEO data revealed that the expressions of PVT1 and CYTOR were up-regulated, while HAR1A and MIAT expressions were downregulated in gliomas. Their expression patterns were validated in an independent cohort containing 98 glioma specimens and 12 non-tumor tissue controls. High expression of PVT1 and CYTOR as well as low HAR1A and MIAT expression were associated with high Ki-67 level and more TP53 mutation. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression analyses showed that glioma patients with high PVT1 expression or low HAR1A expression had poor survival outcome, aberrantly expressed PVT1 and HAR1A could be the independent prognosis biomarkers for glioma patients.

Serum refects disease macroenvironment and thus provides a less invasive means to diagnose  and monitor a diseased condition. By employing 4-plex iTRAQ methodology, we identifed 40 proteins  with diferential abundance in GBM sera. The high abundance of serum S100A8/S100A9 was verifed  by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). ELISA and MRM-based quantitation showed a signifcant  positive correlation. Further, an integrated investigation using stromal, tumor purity and cell type scores  demonstrated an enrichment of myeloid cell lineage in the GBM tumor microenvironment. Transcript  levels of S100A8/S100A9 were found to be independent poor prognostic indicators in GBM. Medium  levels of pre-operative and three-month post-operative follow-up serum S100A8 levels predicted  poor prognosis in GBM patients who lived beyond median survival.

A human glioma transfected with  green flfluorescent protein, displaying diffuse, infifiltrative growth, was implanted intracranially in athymic nude  mice. Image contrast from corresponding regions of interest (ROIs) in in vivo MR and ex vivo flfluorescence images  was quantifified. It was found that all tumor groups had statistically signifificant PpIX flfluorescence contrast and that  PpIX contrast demonstrated the best predictive power for tumor presence. Contrast from gadolinium enhanced  T1-weighted (T1W+ Gd) and absolute T2 images positively predicted the presence of a tumor, confifirmed by the  GFP positive (GFP  + ) and hematoxylin and eosin positive (H&E  + ) ROIs. However, only the absolute T2 images  had predictive power from controls in ROIs that were GFP  + but H&E negative. Additionally, PpIX flfluorescence  and T1W +  Gd image contrast were linearly correlated in both the GFP +  (r = 0.79, p<1×10  8) and H&E + (r  =  0.74, p< 0.003) ROIs.

In this pilot study, we compare L-methyl-11C-methionine PET and MRS for their ability to predict glioma subtypes. Nineteen patients with histologically, confirmed newly diagnosed glioma underwent preoperative L-methyl-11C-methionine PET and MRS in 1 diagnostic session. According to the molecular portfolio and histopatho logic diagnosis, patients were subdivided in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma, IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma, IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion, and with 1p/19q codeletion sub groups. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), creatine, choline, and N-acetyl aspartate peaks were correlated with postoperative histopathologic tumor diagnoses. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio was highest in glioblastoma pa tients (4.18) followed by patients with IDH wild-type grade II and III glioma (3.41). The latter TBRmax values were higher compared with those in patients with IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion (1.95) and in patients with IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted grade II and III glioma (2.79).

Aberrant expression of signal transducer and activator  of transcription 1 (STAT-1) and p53 are known to affect the  occurrence and progression of malignant tumors. The aim of  the present study was to investigate the expression of STAT-1  and mutant p53 gene, as well as their correlation, in patients  with glioma. The present study included 50 patients who  underwent glioma resection at the First Affiliated Hospital of  Inner Mongolia Medical University between December 2007  and December 2011, and 10 patients with acute cerebral contusion who underwent intracerebral hematoma removal at the  same hospital between January 2013 and January 2014. The  expression of STAT-1 and mutant p53 protein in patients with  different grades of glioma was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Spearmans correlation coefficient was employed  to examine the correlation between STAT-1 and the grade of  glioma, and mutant p53 expression. The results demonstrated  that the mean expression of STAT-1 in glioma was significantly  lower compared with normal brain tissue (P<0.05). However,  there was no significant difference in the STAT-1 positive  expression rate between the two groups (χ2 =1.38, P>0.05).

Statistical  analysis revealed a negative correlation between STAT-1  expression and the grade of glioma (r=-0.767, P<0.05). In addition, mutant p53 expression was negatively correlated with  STAT-1 expression in glioma (r=-0.876, P<0.05).

Here we show that the transcription factor PATZ1 gene is upregulated in gliomas compared to normal brain and, among GBMs, is particularly enriched in the proneural subtype and co-localize with stemness markers. Accordingly, in GBM-derived glioma-initiating stem cells (GSCs) PATZ1 is overexpressed compared to differentiated tumor cells and its expression significantly correlates with the characteristic stem cell capacity to grow as neurospheres in vitro. Interestingly, survival analysis demonstrated that PATZ1 lower levels informed poor prognosis in GBM and, specifically, in the proneural subgroup, suggesting it may serve a role as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for intra-subtype heterogeneity of proneural GBM. We also show that PATZ1 suppresses the expression of the mesenchyme-inducer CXCR4, and that PATZ1 and CXCR4 are inversely correlated in GSC and proneural GBM.

Overexpression of miR-346 arrested the cell cycle of glioma cells and inhibited their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. NFIB was a direct target of miR-346, whose expression was reduced by the miRNA.

    "abstract": "In suspected grade II gliomas, three distinct patterns of time-activity curves (TAC) on O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-1-tyrosine (18F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) have been delineated (i) increasing TAC homogeneously throughout the tumor, and decreasing TAC, (ii) either homogeneously throughout the tumor or (iii) only focally within otherwise increasing TAC patterns. Increasing TAC was associated with low-grade histology and decreasing TAC with high-grade histology. This prospective study analyzed whether these patterns correlate with distinct biological tumor subtypes and differential outcome. 18F-FET PET-guided biopsies were used for stepwise histopathological evaluation. Molecular-genetic evaluation included O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutational and 1p/19q codeletion status. Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were obtained from multivariate regression models. 98 adult patients were included. Homogeneous increasing, focal decreasing and homogeneous decreasing TAC were seen in 51, 19 and 28 patients. The corresponding 1-year (2-years) PFS were 92% (85%), 89% (51%) and 50% (28%; p=0.002). IDH1/2 mutations were more frequent in tumors with homogeneous increasing (90%) and focal decreasing (79%) TAC, but were rare in those exhibiting homogeneous decreasing TAC (25%; p<0.001). Overall, TAC patterns, IDH1/2 mutational and 1p/19q codeletion status were powerful and independent prognostic factors. Dynamic 18F-FET PET might be an important and independent imaging biomarker for patients with suspected WHO grade II gliomas and offers perspectives for stratified diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Tumors with focal decreasing TAC need highly targeted surgical interventions to avoid undergrading and undertreatment.",

A large tissue microarray of lower grade glioma (WHO grades II -II, n= 19 patients)and glioblastoma (GBM) (WHO grade IV,n = 50 patients)was stained for EMP2. EMP2 expression was dichotomized to low or high expression scores and correlated with clinical data. The mean EMP2 expression was 1.68 in lower grade gliomas versus 2.20 in GBMs (P = 0.01). The percentage of samples with high EMP2 expression was greatern GBMs than lower grade gliomas (90.0 vs.52.6%,P 0.001). No significant difference was found between median survival among patients with GBM tumors exhibiting high EMP2 expression and survival of those with low EMP2 expression (8.38 VS 10.98 months, p 0.39). However, EMP2 expression 22 correlated with decreased survival (r= 0.39, P=0.001).The EMP2expression level also correlated with Ki-67 positivity(r=0.34, P=0.008).The mortality hazard ratio for GBM patients with EMP2 score of 3 or higher was 1.92 (CI0.69-5.30).

    "abstract": "Background: Noninvasively differentiating therapy-inducedpseudo-progression from recurrent disease in patients with glioblastoma is prospectively difficult due to the current lack of a biologically specific imaging metric.Ferumoxytol iron oxide nanoparticle MRI contrast characterizes innate immunity mediated neuro inflammation; therefore, we hypothesized that combined ferum oxytoland gadolinium enhanced MRI could serve as a biomarker of glioblastoma pseudo-progression. Methods: In this institutional review board approved, retrospective study, we analyzed ferumoxytol and gadolinium contrast enhanced T1-weighted 3T MRIin 45 patients with glioblastoma over multiple clinicaltime points.  IDH-1 mutational status was characterized by exome sequencing.  Sum of products diameter measurements were calculated according to RANO criteria from both gadoliniumand ferumoxytol enhanced sequences.  Enhancement mismatch was calculated as the natural logof the ferumoxytol to gadolinium sum of products diameterratio.  Analysis of varianceand Students t-test assessed differences in mismatch ratios.  P-value <0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results: With the development of pseudo-progressionwe observed asignificantly elevated mismatch ratio when compared to disease recurrence(P< 0.01) within IDH-1 wild type patients.  Patients with IDH-1 mutation demonstrated significantly reduced mismatch ratio with the development of pseudo-progression when compared to disease recurrence(P< 0.01).  Receiver operator curve analysis and specificity for the use of mismatch ratios as a diagnostic biomarker of pseudo-progression. Conclusion:Our study suggests that ferumoxytol to gadolinium contrast mismatch ratios area MRI biomarker for the diagnosis of pseudo-progression in patients with glioblastoma.

Accumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs are involved in glioma proliferation, invasion and drug resistance. Previous studies showed that miR-198 is downregulated in glioblastoma. However, the function of miR-198 in glioblastoma is still unclear. In this study, we report that miR-198 levels were greatly downregulated in glioblastoma specimens and decreased expression of miR-198 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma. And overexpression of miR-198 increased chemosensitivity to temozolomide in vitro and in vivo. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was identified as a direct target of miR-198, and miR-198 overexpression prevented the protein translation of MGMT. Furthermore, overexpression of MGMT restored miR-198-induced chemosensitivity to temozolomide. Moreover, the protein levels of MGMT were upregulated in clinical glioblastoma specimens and inversely correlated with miR-198 levels. In conclusion, our studies revealed that MiR-198 induces chemosensitivity in glioblastoma by targeting MGMT and that miR-198 may be used as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the future.",

Herein, we investigated the expression pattern of ANCR in the course of neural differentiation. Moreover, we used published RNAseq data and clinical samples to evaluate the alteration of ANCR expression in different cell types and brain tumors. Furthermore, we manipulatedANCR expression in glioma cell lines to clarify a potential functional role for ANCR in tumorigenesis.

Western blotting revealed elevated IL-33 protein levels in glioma tissues compared to those in normal brain tissues, and immunohistochemical staining showed higher IL-33 protein expression in glioma tissues than in normal brain tissues. IL-33 expression correlated with the glioma grade (P< 0.001) and KPS score (P= 0.024), and the glioma patients with high IL-33 expression had a shorter PFS (P< 0.001) and OS (P< 0.001) than those with low IL-33 expression.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), accounting for about one third of all brain tumors. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the aggressive grade IV glioma with survival as low as 2-5% in the second year post-diagnosis, hence necessitating efficient diagnostic markers. More than 50% of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases are solitary lesions, often difficult to different from gliomas by conventional imaging diagnostics. Here, we explored the utility of measuring serum expression lev-els of Micro-RNAs (miRs) 221, 608 and 504 as biomarkers for differentiating primary GBMs from solitary metastatc lesions of NSCLC. Methods: Serum expression level of miRs 221, 608 and 504 were determined in 49 GBM, 27 NSCLC brain metastasis patients, and 30 cancer-free normal controls by real time PCR using commercially available miR specific pri-ers. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the expression of each miR between each group. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was also carried out to determine the feasibility of using miR expression as differential diagnosis test. Results: Our results indicated that serum expression of mir-221 was upregulated in GBM as well as in metastatic NSCLC patients. Although both miR-608 and 504 were specifically downregulated only in the GBM patient group, ROC curve analysis showed that only miR-504 serum expression can be utilized as reliable differential diagnosis marker (sesitivity and specificity; 100 and 88.89% respectively)Conclusions: Serum expression level of miR-504 is a reliable biomarker to be used for differentiating primary GBM from solitary brain metastasis of NSCLC.",

However, their prognostic  values are not clear. The aim of this study was to investi gate whether co-expression of MMP-14 and MMP-19 has  prognostic relevance in human gliomas.  Methods  Immunohistochemistry and western blot were  used to investigate the expression of MMP-14 and MMP-  19 proteins in 128 patients with gliomas.  Results  The expression levels of MMP-14 and MMP-19  proteins in glioma tissues were both signifificantly higher  (both P\\0.001) than those in non-neoplastic brain tissues  according to the immunohistochemistry analysis, which  was confifirmed by the western blot analysis. Additionally,  the overexpression of either MMP-14 or MMP-19 was  signifificantly associated with the advanced WHO grade  (both P = 0.02), the low Karnofsky performance score  (KPS) (P = 0.008 and 0.01, respectively) and the poor  overall survival (both P = 0.01). Moreover, the Multivar iate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed  that the increased expressions of MMP-14 and MMP-19  were both independent prognostic factors for poor overall  survival (both P = 0.02). Furthermore, the co-expression  of MMP-14 and MMP-19 was additively and more sig nifificantly (P = 0.006) associated with adverse prognosis in  patients with gliomas than respective expression of MMP-  14 and MMP-19.  Conclusions  These fifindings indicated for the fifirst time  that the co-expression of MMP-14 and MMP-19 is signif icantly correlated with prognosis in glioma patients, sug gesting that the co-expression of these proteins may be  used as both an early diagnostic and independent prog nostic marker.",

Their involvement in certain cancers such as breast and colon cancer is known but in gliomas it remains unexplored till date. The aim of this study was to assess the status of adipokines as prognostic markers of gliomas (low grade gliomas [LGG] and glioblastoma mutiforme [GBM]). Expression status (messenger RNA [mRNA]), overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS) was identified using gene expression profiling interactive analysis server. Clinicopathological analysis and correlation between different adipokines was performed using Xena server. Protein expression status was analyzed using tissue sections from the Human Protein Atlas. Out of 11 adipokines studied visfatin (NAMPT), apelin (APLN), granulin (GRN), serpin peptidase inhibitor/plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI‐1) member 1 (SERPINE1), and chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in both LGG andGBM.Interleukin6(IL6)mRNA was found be significantly upregulated only in GBM. NAMPT, GRN, SERPINE1, and IL6 showed reduced OS as well as worst DFS for patients having higher mRNA expression in LGG. Increased expression of CCL2 showed worst OS in LGG patients while resistin (RETN) and GRN showed the worst OS in GBM patients. Higher expression of RETN, GRN, IL6, SERPINE1, and CCL2 were found to be positively correlated with shorter DFS in GBM. In the clinicopathological analysis, NAMPT, GRN, IL6, SERPINE1, and CCL2 expressions were significantly associated between the neoplasm histological G2 and G3 grades. Furthermore, expression of NAMPT, GRN, tumor necrosis factor, IL6, SERPINE1, and CCL2 were significantly associated with histological type in LGG patients. NAMPT, GRN, SERPINE1, CCL2, and RETN expression were found to be correlated with each other in gliomas. Finally, NAMPT, GRN, and SERPINE1 were also found to be upregulated using immunohistochemistry in a lower grade and high grade gliomas as compared to normal cells. In conclusion, we have identified key adipokines, namely NAMPT, GRN, and SERPINE1 as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers that might be instrumental in the development and progression of gliomas.",

Preliminary screening of an array of tumors implicated proteases (including matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase [TIMPs]) as well as growth factors (including basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) as candidate biomarkers. These data led the authors to hypothesize that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and bFGF would represent high-probability candidates as JPA-specific biomarkers.Methods Urine was collected from 107 patients, which included children with JPA (n = 21), medulloblastoma (n = 17), glioblastoma (n = 9), arteriovenous malformations (n = 25), moyamoya (n = 14), and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 21). Biomarker levels were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, tumor tissue expression was confirmed  with immunohistochemical analysis, and longitudinal biomarker expression was correlated with imaging. Results were subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.Results Using optimal urinary cutoff values of bFGF > 1.0 pg/μg and TIMP3 > 3.5 pg/μg, multiplexing bFGF and TIMP3 predicts JPA presence with 98% accuracy.

To explore new potential biological risk factors for glioblastoma, we investigated alterations in metabolite concentrations in pre-diagnosed serum samples from glioblastoma patients diagnosed up to 22 years after sample collection, and undiseased controls. The study points out a latent biomarker for future glioblastoma consisting of nine metabolites (γ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol, erythritol, erythronic acid, myo-inositol, cystine, 2-keto-L-gluconic acid, hypoxanthine and xanthine) involved in antioxidant metabolism. We detected significantly higher serum concentrations of α-tocopherol (p=0.0018) and γ-tocopherol (p=0.0009) in future glioblastoma cases. Compared to their matched controls, the cases showed a significant average fold increase of α- and γ-tocopherol levels: 1.2 for α-T (p=0.018) and 1.6 for γ-T (p=0.003). These tocopherol levels were associated with a glioblastoma odds ratio of 1.7 (α-T, 95% CI:1.0-3.0) and 2.1 (γ-T, 95% CI:1.2-3.8).

DR6 expression was investigated in low- and high-grade gliomas PCR (n=70), immunofluorescence staining (n=33) and western blot (n=58). Additional analysis of TCGA-data was performed to assess the general alteration of DR6 in cancer and influence of IDH-mutation on DR6 expression in gliomas. Results: The expression of DR6 was significantly enhanced in gliomas (p<0.05). It showed a trend towards rising expression with increasing malignancy of the tumor.

    "abstract": "Glioma constitutes the most frequent brain tumour in man with glioblastoma as the most prevalent and malignant type. The average survival time of less than 16 months underlines the need for improvements in diagnosis and therapy. Here, we report the identification of a novel antigen termed glioma-expressed antigen 2 (GLEA2) causing a frequent immune response in glioma patients. Screening of 450 000 clones from a glioblastoma lambda zap expression library with autologous patient serum revealed a group of five serum-positive clones sharing a high sequence homology. Further sequence analysis showed a sequence homology to a hepatocellular carcinoma associated antigen 58 (HCA58). We localized the novel HCA homologous gene termed glioma-expressed antigen 2 (GLEA2) on chromosome 20 by somatic cell hybrid panel mapping. Using allogenic sera from 39 glioblastoma patients, we found an immune response against GLEA2 in 17 patients (43%). In addition, screening with allogenic sera from other glioma patients revealed GLEA2 directed antibodies in two out of five pilocytic astrocytomas and in one out of two astrocytomas. Unrelated tumour sera revealed no immune response and sera from healthy persons showed an immune response in two out of 14 cases (14%). Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR showed ubiquitous GLEA2 gene expression in glioma and normal tissues. The novel HCA homologous gene, GLEA2, appears to induce a frequent immune response in glioma. In the light of the lack of useful glioma markers, it appears reasonable to consider GLEA2 as a potential future diagnostic marker.",

To evaluate whether the serum concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) may indicate glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients with single supratentorial space-occupying lesions, we prospectively examined 50 consecutive patients with histologically proven GBM,World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV, 14 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III), 4 patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 13 patients with diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II), 17 patients with a single cerebral metastasis and 50 healthy controls. Serum was taken from the patients before tumour resection or stereotactic biopsy. Serum GFAP levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA test and were detectable in 40 out of the 50 GBM patients (median: 0.18 kg/l; range: 0^5.6 kg/l). The levels were significantly elevated compared with those of the non-GBM tumour patients and healthy controls (median: 0 kg/l; range: 0^0.024 kg/l; P _ 0.0001, respectively). Non-GBM tumour patients and all healthy subjects showed zero serum GFAP levels. There was a significant correlation between tumour volume (Spearman Rho, CC = 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.2^0.67; P_0.001), tumour necrosis volume (CC=0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.2^0.72; P = 0.004), the amount of necrotic GFAP positive cells (CC = 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.29^0.81; P = 0.007) and serum GFAP level among the GBM patients. A serum GFAP level of `0.05 kg/l was 76% sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of GBM in patients with a single supratentorial mass lesion in this series.

    "abstract": "Background. Molecular biomarkers including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and O6methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation may improve prognostication and guide treatment decisions for patients with World Health Organization (WHO) anaplastic gliomas. At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays (HM450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation profiles and genome-wide DNA copy number changes. Algorithms have been developed to detect the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G- CIMP) associated with IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT promoter methylation using a single assay. Methods. Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n 1⁄4 115 patients) of the NOA-04 trial. Results. Concordance for IDH and 1p/19q status was very high: In 92% of samples, the HM450 and reference data agreed. In discordant samples, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the HM450 analysis. The HM450-derived MGMT-STP27 model to calculate MGMT promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a significantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-specific PCR, with 87 of 91 G-CIMP tumors predicted as MGMT promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of discordant samples confirmed the HM450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases. Conclusions. G-CIMP and 1p/19q codeletion are reliably detectable by HM450 analysis and are associated with prognosis in the NOA04 trial. For MGMT, HM450 suggests promoter methylation in the vast majority of G-CIMP tumors, which is supported by pyrosequencing.",

    "abstract": "Cripto‐1 has been implicated in a number of human cancers. Although there is  high potential for a role of Cripto‐1 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  pathogenesis and progression, few studies have tried to define its role in GBM.  These studies were limited in that Cripto‐1 expression was not studied in detail in  relation to markers of cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, these  correlative studies allowed limited interpretation of Criptos‐1's effect on the  various aspects of GBM development using the U87 GBM cell line. In this study,  we sought to delineate the role of Cripto‐1 in facilitating pathogenesis, stemness,  proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis in GBM. Our findings show  that upon overexpressing Cripto‐1 in U87 GBM cells, the stemness markers  Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and CD44 increased expression. Similarly, an increase in Ki67  was observed demonstrating Cripto‐1's potential to induce cellular proliferation.  Likewise, we report a novel finding that increased expression of the markers of  migration and invasion, Vimentin and Twist, correlated with upregulation of  Cripto‐1. Moreover, Cripto‐1 exposure led to VEGFR‐2 overexpression along with  higher tube formation under conditions promoting endothelial growth. Taken  together our results support a role for Cripto‐1 in the initiation, development,  progression, and maintenance of GBM pathogenesis. The data presented here are  also consistent with a role for Cripto‐1 in the re‐growth and invasive growth in  GBM. This highlights its potential use as a predictive and diagnostic marker in  GBM as well as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Background: Glioma is the most common primary malignant central nervous system tumor in adult, and is usually not curable due to its invasive nature. Establishment of serum biomarkers for glioma would be beneficial both for early diagnosis and adequate therapeutic intervention. Filamins are an actin cross-linker and filamin C (FLNC), normally restricted in muscle tissues, offers many signaling molecules an essential communication fields. Recently, filamins have been considered important for tumorigenesis in cancers. Methods: We searched for novel glioma-associated antigens by serological identification of antigens utilizing recombinant cDNA expression cloning (SEREX), and found FLNC as a candidate protein. Tissue expressions of FLNC (both in normal and tumor tissues) were examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Serum anti-FLNC autoantibody level was measured by ELISA in normal volunteers and in the patients with various grade gliomas. Results: FLNC was expressed in glioma tissues and its level got higher as tumor grade advanced. Anti-FLNC autoantibody was also detected in the serum of glioma patients, but its levels were inversely correlated with the tissue expression. Serum anti-FLNC autoantibody level was significantly higher in low-grade glioma patients than in high-grade glioma patients or in normal volunteers, which was confirmed in an independent validation set of patients' sera. The autoantibody levels in the patients with meningioma or cerebral infarction were at the same level of normal volunteers, and they were significantly lower than that of low-grade gliomas. Total IgG and anti-glutatione S-transferase (GST) antibody level were not altered among the patient groups, which suggest that the autoantibody response was specific for FLNC. Conclusions: The present results suggest that serum anti-FLNC autoantibody can be a potential serum biomarker for early diagnosis of low-grade gliomas while it needs a large-scale clinical study.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies reported that miR-433 exerts function widely in human  tumorigenesis and development. Here, we further investigate the potential role of  miR-433 in glioma. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that miR-433-3p and  miR-433-5p were low expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. Functional studies  suggested that the overexpression of miR-433-3p suppressed proliferation, induced  apoptosis and inhibited invasion and migration of human glioma cells. But the growth  and metastasis of glioma cells were not significantly influenced by overexpression of  miR-433-5p. In a xenograft model, we also showed that miR-433-3p had an inhibitory  effect on the growth of glioma. Bioinformatics coupled with luciferase and western blot  assays revealed that CREB is a direct target of miR-433-3p, and the overexpression  of CREB can rescue the phenotype changes induced by miR-433-3p overexpression.  Besides, miR-433-3p could increase chemosensitivity of glioma to temozolomide by  targeting CREB in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "Ependymomas are gliomas that recapitulate normal ependymal cells. The epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) shows \"dot-like\" and \"ring-like\" staining patterns, highlighting \"microlumens\" or intracytoplasmic rosettes, a pathognomonic ultrastructural feature. NHERF1/EBP50, an adaptor protein localized at the apical plasma membrane of human epithelia, has been found to localize to these microlumens. We aimed to analyze the staining patterns of EMA and EBP50 in ependymomas and other tumors, and thereby compare their diagnostic utility. Sixty-three ependymomas of different grades and 44 nonependymal tumors (meningiomas, 5; pilocytic astrocytoma, 2; paraganglioma, 2; neurocytoma, 4; pituitary adenoma, 3; papillary tumor of pineal region, 3; oligodendroglioma, 4; choroid plexus papilloma, 3; medulloblastoma, 2; schwannoma, 2; cellular hemangioblastoma, 2; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, 1; glioblastoma multiforme, 8; diffuse astrocytoma, 1; anaplastic astrocytoma, 1; and pilomyxoid astrocytoma, 1) were included. Ring-like positivity was 100% specific for ependymomas, but showed a poor sensitivity (EMA, 29%; EBP50, 37%). Dot EMA positivity was more sensitive in grade III ependymomas (100%), whereas dot EBP50 positivity was more sensitive in grade I subependymomas (80%) and myxopapillary ependymomas (40%). Among grade II ependymomas, EBP50 labeled a significantly higher number of dots and rings, which may be of value in small biopsies. Focal dot positivity for EMA and EBP50 in glioblastoma multiforme and meningioma contributed to the lowered specificity (EMA, 84%; EBP50, 80%). Myxopapillary ependymomas (60%), choroid plexus papillomas (66%), and papillary tumors of pineal region (100%) showed membranous staining with EBP50. Although EPB50 appears to be a better diagnostic marker for grade I/II ependymomas, we recommend a combined panel of EMA and EBP50 for grade III ependymomas to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of EBP50 in this subgroup.Normal ependymal cells lining the ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord are arranged as a single layer of cuboidal cells with adherens junctions, basally located nuclei, and a specialized apical plasma membrane that contains cilia and microvilli. They resemble glandular epithelial cells, but differ in lacking well-defined basement membranes, desmosomes, and tonofilaments.1 Ependymomas are relatively rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors that recapitulate the light microscopic and ultrastructural features of normal ependymal cells.2 Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells typically exhibit numerous microvilli and cilia in the cytoplasm and on the surface, in addition to cell junctions and basement membrane-like structures.3 Intracytoplasmic lumen or microlumen (ML) formation is a highly characteristic ultrastructural feature,4 and these lumens contain microvilli with or without cilia. Ciliated MLs are hypothesized to originate from the distention of the periciliary cisterns, which subsequently enlarge by fusion with cytoplasmic vesicles or other MLs. When they communicate with the intercellular spaces, they form the true ependymal rosettes (TER) and true ependymal canals (TEC) seen on light microscopy.4 Nonciliated MLs are less commonly seen and possibly represent a degenerative phenomenon or invaginations of the extracellular space.4 According to the latest World Health Organisation classification of tumors of the CNS, ependymomas are accorded 3 grades: grade I, including the subependymomas (SEs) of the ventricular surfaces and the myxopapillary ependymomas (MPEs) of the lumbosacral regions; grade II, classical ependymomas (EPII); and grade III, anaplastic ependymomas (EPIII).2 Common morphologic variants exhibiting papillary, tanycytic, or clear cell patterns may be seen in grade II or III ependymomas.2 The histopathologic diagnosis of ependymomas is straightforward in a classical case that shows the formation of TER and TEC. However, the latter are rare histologic findings and in most instances, specific immunohistochemistry is required to confirm the diagnosis.In addition, ependymomas exhibit a wide range of morphologic variations leading to a long list of potential histologic mimics.2 These include the following: oligodendrogliomas and neurocytomas in clear cell variants; medulloblastomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in cellular and anaplastic variants; choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs), papillary tumor of pineal region (PTPRs), and papillary meningiomas (MEs) in papillary variants; and pilocytic astrocytomas and schwannomas in tanycytic variants. Glial fibrillary acidic protein is the most commonly used immunohistochemical marker, but it does not help in differentiation from other gliomas. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) is another commonly used diagnostic marker, which shows \"dot-like\" and \"ring-like\" staining patterns,5 highlighting MLs.4,6 Recently, NHERF1/ EBP50 [Na+/H+ exchanger 3-regulating factor 1/ezrinradixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50], an adaptor protein localized at the apical plasma membrane of human epithelia, has been found to localize to the MLs of ependymomas with high sensitivity and specificity, and is suggested as a superior diagnostic marker for ependymomas.7,8 We undertook this study to analyze the immunohistochemical staining patterns of EMA and EBP50 in ependymomas of all ages, sites, and grades, and other tumors that enter in the differential diagnosis, and thereby compare their specificities and sensitivities in the diagnosis of these tumors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive radiologic evaluation of glioma can facilitate correct diagnosis and detection of malignant  transformation. Although positron-emission tomography is considered valuable in the care of patients with gliomas, 18F-flfluorodeoxyglucose and  11C-methionine have reportedly shown ambiguous results in terms of grading and prognostication. The present study compared the diagnostic  and prognostic capabilities of diffusion tensor imaging, FDG, and 11C-methionine PET in nonenhancing gliomas.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-fifive consecutive newly diagnosed, histologically confifirmed nonenhancing gliomas that underwent  both FDG and 11C-methionine PET were retrospectively investigated (23 grade II and 12 grade III gliomas). Apparent diffusion coeffificient,  fractional anisotropy, and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios of both FDG and 11C-methionine PET were compared between grade II and III  gliomas. Prognostic values of these parameters were also tested by using progression-free survival.  RESULTS: Grade III gliomas showed signifificantly higher average tumor-to-normal tissue and maximum tumor-to-normal tissue than grade II  gliomas in 11C-methionine (P  .013, P  .0017, respectively), but not in FDG-PET imaging. There was no signifificant difference in average ADC,  minimum ADC, average fractional anisotropy, and maximum fractional anisotropy. 11C-methionine PET maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of  2.0 was most suitable for detecting grade III gliomas among nonenhancing gliomas (sensitivity, 83.3%; specifificity, 73.9%). Among patients not  receiving any adjuvant therapy, median progression-free survival was 64.2  7.2 months in patients with maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio  of 2.0 for 11C-methionine PET and 18.6  6.9 months in patients with maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 2.0 (P= .0044).

The aim of the present study was to explore whether 2HG in plasma and urine could predict the presence of IDH1/2 mutations in patients with glioma.Materials and Methods. All patients had histological confir mation of glioma and a recent brain magnetic resonance imaging scan showing the neoplastic lesion. Plasma and urine samples were taken from all patients, and the 2HG concen trations were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results. A total of 84 patients were enrolled: 38 with R132H IDH1 mutated and 46 with wild type.Among the 38 patients with mutant IDH1, 21 had high-grade glioma and 17 had low-grade glioma. Among the 46 patients with IDH1 wild-type glioma, 35 and 11 had high- and low-grade glioma, respectively. In all patients, we analyzed the mean 2HG concentration in the plasma, urine, and plasma/urine ratio (Ratio_2HG).We found a significant difference in the Ratio_2HG between patients with and without an IDH1 mutation (22.268.7 vs. 15.666.8; p , .0001).The optimal cutoff value for Ratio_2HG to identify IDH1 mutation was 19 (sensitivity, 63%; specificity, 76%; accuracy, 70%). In the patients with high-grade glioma only, the optimal cutoff value was 20 (sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 89%; accuracy, 84%; positive predictive value, 80%; negative predictive value, 86%). In 7 of 7 patients with high-grade glioma, we found a correlation between the Ratio_2HG value and the response to treatment. Conclusion.

    "abstract": "Background: Dysregulated zinc transport has been observed in many cancers. However, the status of zinc homeostasis and the expression profile of zinc transporters in brain and brain tumors have not been reported.\n\nMethods: The gene profiles of 14 zinc importers (ZIPs) and 10 zinc exporters (ZnTs) in patients with glioma were studied by investigating the association between the zinc transporters and brain tumor characteristics (tumor grade and overall survival time). Three independent cohorts were analyzed to cross-validate the findings: the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGCA) cohort (n = 186), the US National Cancer Institute Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) cohort (n = 335), and The University of Texas (UT) cohort (n = 34).\n\nResults: The expression of ZIP3, 4, 8, 14, ZnT5, 6, and 7 were increased, and the expression of ZnT10 was decreased in grade IV gliomas, compared with grade II gliomas. Among all 24 zinc transporters, ZIP4 is most significantly associated with tumor grade and overall survival; this finding is consistent across 2 independent cohorts (CGCA and REMBRANDT) and is partially validated by the third cohort (UT). High ZIP4 expression was significantly associated with higher grade of gliomas and shorter overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-2.53, P = .040 in CGCA cohort; hazard ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.61, P = .007 in REMBRANDT cohort).\n\nConclusions: Dysregulated expression of zinc transporters is involved in the progression of gliomas. Our results suggest that ZIP4 may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for gliomas.",

    "abstract": "The neurotrophin receptors are known to promote growth and proliferation of  glioblastoma cells. Their functions in spreading glioblastoma cell aggressiveness to  the microenvironment through exosome release from glioblastoma cells are unknown. Considering previous reports demonstrating that YKL-40 expression is associated  with undifferentiated glioblastoma cancer stem cells, we used YKL-40-silenced cells  to modulate the U87-MG differentiated state and their biological aggressiveness.  Herein, we demonstrated a relationship between neurotrophin-receptors and  YKL-40 expression in undifferentiated cells. Differential functions of cells and  derived-exosomes were evidenced according to neurotrophin receptor content and  differentiated cell state by comparison with control pLKO cells. YKL-40 silencing of glioblastoma cells impairs proliferation, neurosphere  formation, and their ability to induce endothelial cell (HBMEC) migration. The  modulation of differentiated cell state in YKL-40-silenced cells induces a decrease of  TrkB, sortilin and p75NTR cellular expressions, associated with a low-aggressiveness  phenotype. Interestingly, TrkB expressed in exosomes derived from control cells  was undetectable in exosomes from YKL-40 -silenced cells. The transfer of TrkBcontaining exosomes in YKL-40-silenced cells contributed to restore cell proliferation  and promote endothelial cell activation. Interestingly, in U87 MG xenografted mice,  TrkB-depleted exosomes from YKL-40-silenced cells inhibited tumor growth in vivo. These data highlight that TrkB-containing exosomes play a key role in the control  of glioblastoma progression and aggressiveness. Furthermore, TrkB expression was  detected in exosomes isolated from plasma of glioblastoma patients, suggesting that  this receptor may be considered as a new biomarker for glioblastoma diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EV), as the intercellular information transfer molecules which can regulate the tumor microenvironment, promote migration and tumor progression. Previous studies reported that EV from endothelial cells was used to guide the fate and survival of gliomas, but many researches focus on normal human endothelial cells (NhEC) rather than tumor-derived endothelial cells. Our laboratory isolated human endothelial cells from glioma issue (GhEC). We have previously demonstrated that EV from GhEC and NhEC, which both can promote glioma stem cells (GSC) proliferation and tumorsphere formation in vitro and tumourigenicity in vivo by the transfer of CD9. However, NhEC-EV or GhEC-EV could suppress glioma cells (GC) proliferation in vitro. It demonstrates the undifferentiated impact of EV. Here, we first compared GhEC-EV proteins with NhEC-EV (Screening criteria: GhEC-EV/NhEC-EV, FC > 1.5), and obtained 70 differential expression proteins, most of which were associated with invasion and migration. We found that GhEC or GhEC-EV preferred promoting GC migration than treating with NhEC or NhEC-EV. In terms of mechanism, we further revealed that EV-mediated transfer of MYO1C induced glioma cell LN229 migration. Knockdown of MYO1C in GhEC or GhEC-EV suppressed this effect. Overexpression of MYO1C promoted migration on the contrary. MYO1C was also detected in glioma cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is more suitable as a liquid biopsy biomarker and contributes to early diagnosis and monitoring in glioma. Our findings provide a new proteindMYO1C in EV to target tumor blood vessels, and bring a new point-cut to the treatment of gliomablastoma (GBM).",

    "abstract": "Background: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (IGFBP) isoforms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human neoplasms including glioma. In view of this, we evaluated the expression of IGFBP isoforms (IGFBP-2, -3, and -5) during malignant progression of astrocytoma and their prognostic significance in glioblastoma.  Methods: The expression of IGFBP isoforms was analyzed in diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas by realtime quantitative PCR (n = 203) and immunohistochemistry (n = 256). Statistical methods were used to assess their grade-specific expression pattern and mRNA-protein intercorrelation. Survival analyses were done on a uniformly treated, prospective cohort of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n = 136) by using Cox regression models.  Results: The mean transcript levels of IGFBP-2 and -3 were significantly higher in glioblastomas (GBM) relative to anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), diffuse astrocytoma (DA), and controls whereas IGFBP-5 mRNA was higher in GBM relative to AA and controls (P < 0.05). By immunohistochemistry, the mean labeling index of all isoforms was significantly higher in GBM compared with AA, DA, and control (P < 0.05). A strong positive correlation was observed between their respective mRNA and protein expressions (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed IGFBP-3 expression (hazard ratio, 1.021; P = 0.030) and patient age (hazard ratio, 1.027; P = 0.007) to be associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma.  Conclusions: This study shows the associations of IGFBP-2, -3, and -5 expression with increasing grades of malignancy in astrocytomas. IGFBP-3 is identified as a novel prognostic glioblastoma biomarker. The strong correlation between their mRNA and protein expression patterns suggests their role in the pathogenesis of these tumors.  Impact: IGFBP isoforms have emerged as biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic utility in astrocytomas. ",

To identify tumor-associated antigens in GBM patients may find potential diagnostic markers and immunotherapeutic targets. In this study, we identified a gene termed URGCP using the serological identification of antigens by recombinant A2B5 positive glioma cDNA library. The gene product of URGCP is immunogenic in GBM after tested in allogenic patients serum screening. Methods and results: GBM patients with an auto-antibody response against URGCP show longer survival than those without URGCP response. In additional, we show that URGCP was high expression in most GBM tissues and cell lines compared with normal brain tissues and majorly co-expressed with stem cell marker A2B5. Conclusion: We identified a potential new biomarker of GBM, URGCP.

Methods: The gene profiles of AJAP1 in glioma patients were studied among four independent cohorts. Confocal imaging was used to analyze the AJAP1 localization. After AJAP1 overexpression in GBM cell lines, cellular polarity, cytoskeleton distribution, and antitumor effect were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: AJAP1 expression was significantly decreased in gliomas compared with normal brain in REMBRANDT and CGCA cohorts. Additionally, low AJAP1 expression was associated with worse survival in GBMs in REMBRANDT and TCGA U133A cohorts and was significantly associated with classical and mesenchymal subtypes of GBMs among four cohorts. Confocal imaging indicated AJAP1 localized in cell membranes in low-grade gliomas and AJAP1-overexpressing GBM cells, but difficult to assess in high-grade gliomas due to its absence. AJAP1 overexpression altered the cytoskeleton and cellular polarity in vitro and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo.

    "abstract": "Identification of tumor-derived proteins in the circulation may allow for early detection of cancer and evaluation of therapeutic responses. To identify circulating tumor-derived proteins, mice were immunized with concentrated culture medium conditioned by human breast cancer cells. Antibodies generated by hybridomas were screened against conditioned media from both normal epithelial cells and tumor cells. Antibody selectively reacting with tumor cell-conditioned media was further characterized. This led to the development of a monoclonal antibody (Alper-p280) that reacts with a newly identified 280-kDa secreted variant of human filaminA. Circulating filamin-A was detected in patient plasma samples using Alper-p280 in an ELISA assay. Human plasma samples from 134 patients with brain, breast, or ovarian cancer, 15 patients with active arthritis, and 76 healthy controls were analyzed. Filamin-A protein levels in human cell lines and tissues were analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and electron and confocal microscopy. Circulating filamin-A was detected in the plasma of 109 of 143 patients with breast cancer and primary brain tumors. Plasma levels of filamin-A showed 89.5% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67% to 0.99%) and 97.8% specificity (95%CI = 0.88% to 0.99%) for glioblastoma at a cut-off of 21.0 ng/mL. Plasma levels of filamin-A (>36.0 ng/mL) had 96.7% sensitivity (95%CI = 0.80% to 0.99%) and 67.8% specificity (95% CI = 0.54% to 0.79%) for metastatic breast cancer. Filamin-A levels were increased in malignant breast or brain tissues, but not in normal control tissues. Filamin-A localized to lysosomes in MDA.MB.231 breast cancer cells, but not in normal human mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that filamin-A may undergo cancer-specific processing. Plasma filamin-A appears to be a specific and sensitive marker for patients with high-grade astrocytoma or metastatic breast cancer.

    "abstract": "Background Astrogliomas are the most common primary brain tumor. Its progression is the result of activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), and expression of various growth factors. The angiogenesis and p53 in astrogliomas play an important role in its grading, treatment strategies, and hence its clinical outcome. Objectives To analyze the frequency of presentation and the possible co-expression of p53 and angiogenesis marker (CD31) and their clinical implications in astrogliomas. Material and methods This retrograde study included 45 cases with astrocytomas in the form of paraffin blocks. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to determine the type and histological grade according to WHO (2007) classification of CNS tumors. Immunostaining was done using anti p53 and CD31 and the results were measured as labeling index (LI) using image analyzer system CAS-200. Results Both p53 and CD31 expressions were correlated well with the histopathological grades of different subtypes of astrogliomas with good discrimination between low and high grades. Overall, a highly significant statistical correlation was observed between the grades of astrocytomas and the p53 and CD31 labeling indices. The expressions of p53 and CD31 were markedly increased in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with mean values (59.7 ± 13.5) (P = 0.0001) and (40.7 ± 8.9) (P = 0.001), respectively. Obviously, these observations demonstrate that the co-expression and increased levels of p53 and CD31 in astrogliomas are increasing as the tumor grade is increasing. Conclusion The estimation of p53 and CD31 could be used as good tools to assess the grade, prognosis, and aggressiveness of the astroglial tumors. Thus, the two markers can be used as adjunct to the diagnosis and stratification of the high grade from the low-grade intrinsic brain astrogliomas.",

Diagnostic biomarkers would be clinically meaningful to allow for early detection of the tumorand for those cases in which surgery is contraindicated or biopsy results are inconclusive. Recent findings show that GBM cells release microvesicles that contain a select subset of cellular proteins and RNA. The aim of this hypothesis-generating study was to assess the diagnostic potential of miRNAs found in microvesicles isolated from the serum of GBM patients. Methods. To control disease heterogeneity, we used patients with newly diagnosed GBM. In the discovery stage, PCR-based TaqMan Low Density Arrays followed by individual quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were used to test the differences in the miRNA expression levels of serum microvesicles among 25 GBM patients and healthy controls paired by age and sex. The detected noncoding RNAs were then validated in another 50 GBM patients. Results. We found that the expression levels of 1 small noncoding RNA (RNU6-1) and 2 microRNAs (miR-320 and miR-574-3p) were significantly associated with a GBM diagnosis. In addition, RNU6-1 was consistently an independent predictor of a GBM diagnosis. Conclusions. Altogether our results uncovered a small noncoding RNA signature in microvesicles isolated from GBM patient serum that could be used as a fast and reliable differential diagnostic biomarker.",

However, its functions have been seldom investigated in brain cancers. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used for the detection of the PomGnT1 protein in 133 cases of glioma tissues. Spearman correlation analysis was used for the relationship between PomGnT1 staining and the glioma grade. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to measure the diagnostic value of PomGnT1 protein in the degree of glioma malignance. We found that PomGnT1 expression was correlated with glioma grade, and it could be used as a marker to distinguish low- and high-grade gliomas. Stably transfected U87 cells were constructed to overexpress short hairpin RNA of PomGnT1. Immunofluorescence test detected that this protein also could restrain the generation of U87 cells' pseudopodia. Western blotting further showed that the PomGnT1 protein had an impact on the c-myc protein level.

    "abstract": "There are no previous studies of the association between prediagnostic serum vitamin D concentration and glioma. Vitamin D has immunosuppressive properties; as does glioma. It was, therefore, our hypothesis that elevated vitamin D concentration would increase glioma risk. We conducted a nested case-control study using specimens from the Janus Serum Bank cohort in Norway. Blood donors who were subsequently diagnosed with glioma (n = 592), between 1974 and 2007, were matched to donors without glioma (n = 1112) on date and age at blood collection and sex. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH)D], an indicator of vitamin D availability, using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Seasonally adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for each control quintile of 25(OH)D using conditional logistic regression. Among men diagnosed with high grade glioma >56, we found a negative trend (P = .04). Men diagnosed   56 showed a borderline positive trend (P = .08). High levels (>66 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D in men >56 were inversely related to high grade glioma from  2 yr before diagnosis (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.91) to  15 yr before diagnosis (OR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.38,0.96).

    "abstract": " High-grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common and most aggressive intrinsic human brain tumors in adults. Galectin-1, a glycan-binding protein that is overexpressed in HGG, has been shown to contribute signiﬁcantly to the aggressive nature of HGG. It is unknown whether increased galectin-1 expression levels are exclusively found at the tumor site or whether galectin-1 can also be detected in the serum of HGG patients. Galectin-1 serum levels were analyzed in a prospective dataset of 43 healthy controls and 125 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG. Samples were taken at the moment of surgical resection and/or 2-3 weeks after surgery. Galectin-1 serum levels were determined using an ELISA for galectin-1. Galectin-1 serum levels depended signiﬁcantly on age and sex in the control group. Age- and sex-adjusted galectin-1 serum levels were signiﬁcantly higher in all patient subgroups compared to healthy controls with a high discriminative ability that increased with age. We did not observe a signiﬁcant decrease in the galectin-1 serum levels upon surgical resection of the tumor. Collectively, the data presented here may represent a ﬁrst step to establish galectin-1 as a biomarker in HGG disease monitoring. Further longitudinal evaluation is required and ongoing to investigate the value of galectin-1 serum levels in HGG patients as an additional diagnostic marker, but more importantly as a predictor of treatment response and prognosis. Furthermore, galectin-1 serum levels could also provide an important tool for the identiﬁcation of HGG patients that could beneﬁt from galectin-1 directed therapies that are currently under development.",

    "abstract": "Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is a benign brain tumor mostly associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. However, it may be misinterpreted as other high-grade brain tumors due to the presence of large tumor cells with conspicuous pleomorphism and occasional atypical features, such as tumor necrosis and endothelial proliferation. In this study, we first investigated thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression in a large series of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and other histologic and locational mimics to validate the diagnostic utility of this marker. We then examined TTF-1 expression in non-neoplastic brain tissue to determine the cell origin of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Twenty-four subependymal giant cell astrocytoma specimens were subjected to tissue microarray construction. For comparison, a selection of tumors, including histologic mimics (21 gemistocytic astrocytomas and 24 gangliogliomas), tumors predominantly occurring at the ventricular system (50 ependymomas, 19 neurocytomas, and 7 subependymomas), and 134 astrocytomas (3 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, 45 diffuse astrocytomas, 46 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 40 glioblastomas) were used. Immunohistochemical stain for TTF-1 was positive in all 24 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, whereas negative in all astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, ependymomas, and subependymomas. Neurocytomas were positive for TTF-1 in 4/19 (21%) of cases using clone 8G7G3/1 and in 9/19 (47%) of cases using clone SPT24. In the three fetal brains that we examined, TTF-1 expression was seen in the medial ganglionic eminence, a transient fetal structure between the caudate nucleus and the thalami. There was no BRAFV600E mutation identified by direct sequencing in the 20 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that we studied. In conclusion, TTF-1 is a useful marker in distinguishing subependymal giant cell astrocytoma from its mimics. Expression of TTF-1 in the fetal medial ganglionic eminence indicates that subependymal giant cell astrocytoma may originate from the progenitor cells in this region.",

In the present study, miR-130b expression was upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the upregulation of miR-130b expression correlated with poor prognoses in glioma patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that this upregulation and a high-grade classification were independent factors that both predicted poor outcomes for glioma patients. Dual-luciferase assays identified that the cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene is a direct target of miR-130b. Functional studies demonstrated that a miR-130b mimic significantly promoted the growth and invasion of glioma cells, while also inhibiting apoptosis via selective targeting of CYLD, which was enhanced by CYLD-targeted siRNA. In contrast, a miR-130b inhibitor suppressed these biological behaviors, and this inhibition was reversed by CYLD-targeted siRNA. These data revealed that miR-130b could act as a novel potential diagnostic biomarker for glioma, while also demonstrating the importance of miR-130b in the cell proliferation and progression of glioma, indicating that it may serve as a useful therapeutic target for glioma.",

The diagnostic value of  serum LINK-A lncRNA for glioma was evaluated by receiver  operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Potential  correlations between serum levels of LINK-A lncRNA and  survivin were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient.  LINK-A lncRNA siRNA, LINK-A lncRNA-carrying expression vector and survivin-carrying expression vector were  transfected into glioma cells, and the effects on LINK-A  lncRNA expression, survivin expression and cell apoptosis  were explored by RT-qPCR, western blot analysis and annexin  V/propidium iodide staining. It was observed that the serum  levels of LINK-A lncRNA and survivin were significantly  higher in patients with glioma compared with healthy controls.  Increased levels of LINK-A lncRNA distinguished glioma  patients from healthy controls, based on ROC curve analysis.  Serum levels of LINK-A lncRNA and survivin were positively  correlated in glioma patients, but not in healthy controls.  Overexpression of LINK-A lncRNA led to increased survivin  protein expression, while survivin overexpression had no  effect on LINK-A lncRNA expression. LINK-A lncRNA and  survivin overexpression each reduced glioma cell apoptosis,  but LINK-A lncRNA siRNA-mediated knockdown increased  apoptosis. Survivin overexpression attenuated the inducing  effects of LINK-A lncRNA knockdown on apoptosis.

    "abstract": "Fibrillary astrocytoma, the most common primary central nervous system neoplasm, is infiltrating, rapidly proliferating, and almost invariably fatal. This contrasts with the biologically distinct pilocytic astrocytoma, which is circumscribed, often cystic, slowly proliferating, and associated with a favorable long-term outcome. Diagnostic markers for distinguishing pilocytic astrocytomas from infiltrating anaplastic astrocytomas are currently not available. To identify genes that might either serve as markers or explain these distinct biologic behaviors, cDNA microarray analysis was used to compare the expression of 7,073 genes (nearly one quarter of the human genome) between these 2 types of astrocytoma. Messenger RNAs pooled from 3 pilocytic astrocytomas and from 4 infiltrating anaplastic astrocytomas were compared. Apolipoprotein D (apoD), which expressed 8.5-fold higher in pilocytic astrocytomas, showed the greatest level of differential expression and emerged as a potential marker for pilocytic tumors. By immunohistochemistry, 10 of 13 pilocytic astrocytomas stained positively for apoD, while none of 21 infiltrating astrocytomas showed similar staining. ApoD immunostaining was also seen in 9 of 14 of gangliogliomas, 4 of 5 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), and a single pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs). By in situ hybridization, pilocytic astrocytomas, in contrast with infiltrating astrocytomas, showed widespread increased apoD expression. SAGE analysis using the NCBI database showed a higher level of expression of apoD RNA in pilocytic astrocytoma than in any of the other 94 neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues in the database. ApoD is associated with decreased proliferation in some cell lines, and is the protein found in highest concentration in cyst fluid from benign cystic disease of the breast. ApoD might play a role in either decreased proliferation or cyst formation in pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, SEGAs, and PXAs.",

    "abstract": "Background. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of human brain tumor. It was previously shown that high levels of laminin-8 expression were a predictor of tumor recurrence and patient survival. It is thus important to elucidate the mechanism by which laminin-8 expression is regulated and determine how this contributes to glioma progression. This study investigated the mechanism of regulation of LAMB1, which encodes the b1 chain of laminin-8, in glioma cells lines and in a mouse model of GBM.  Methods. The expression levels of LAMB1 and miR-124-5p were examined in glioma cell lines (U87 and U251) and GBM tissue samples by quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The potential regulation of LAMB1 by miR-124-5p was investigated by assessing the effects of restored miR-124-5p expression on cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth and angiogenesis. The effects of inhibiting LAMB1 on tumor growth and angiogenesis were also assessed.  Results. The upregulation of LAMB1 expression was highly correlated with the downregulation of miR-124-5p. LAMB1 protein expression was suppressed by miR-124-5p. The restoration of miR-124-5p expression suppressed glioma growth by inhibiting angiogenesis, effects that were also observed upon LAMB1 knockdown.  Conclusions. The findings indicate that miR-124-5p functions as a diagnosis and as a tumor suppressor and could serve as a molecular marker for glioma potential therapeutic target in GBM treatment",

    "abstract": "Glioblastomas are the most aggressive brain tumors. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are thought to be responsible for the recurrence, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis of glioblastoma. Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), which is a cellular chaperone for a variety of omega-3 fatty acids, is a known marker for neural stem cells. In this study, using a newly developed anti-FABP7 antibody and patient-derived GSC lines, we evaluated the expression of FABP7 in GSCs. Using immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and qPCR analyses, FABP7 was found to be highly enriched in GSCs and its localization was found in cytosol and nuclei. FABP7 expression was significantly downregulated in differentiated GSCs induced by the addition of serum. In the glioma surgical specimens, FABP7 was highly expressed in the majority of glioblastoma. Double immunostaining for FABP7 and Sox2 showed that FABP7+Sox2+ tumor cells were significantly increased in glioblastoma (grade IV) compared with diffuse astrocytoma (grade II) and anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III). Our data introduces FABP7 as a marker for GSCs and further highlights its possible significance for glioma diagnosis and treatment. ",

    "abstract": "Background: Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) in the circulation has been documented to activate global immunosuppression and is considered a predictor of negative clinical outcomes in several malignances. However, the clinical significance of sPD-L1 in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with glioma remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to detect the correlations of sPD-L1 with clinical features in brain tumors and assess the diagnostic value of this protein in gliomas. Methods: Serum samples were obtained from 73 patients with glioma, 20 patients with meningioma, and 49 healthy controls (HCs) in this study. In total, 31 CSF samples were collected from the matched glioma patients, and seven samples were collected from the matched meningioma patients. The expression of serum sPD-L1 in the glioma cohort was followed for 20 days after surgery to examine the kinetics in the circulation. Inflammatory markers were evaluated based on preoperative blood parameters. The sPD-L1 levels in the serum and CSF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The logistic regression model was used to assess the independent associations of sPD-L1 with gliomas, including high-grade gliomas. Results: Serum and CSF levels of sPD-L1 were significantly elevated in patients with gliomas compared to those with meningiomas and HCs. Additionally, increased levels of sPD-L1 were observed in relatively advanced tumors. sPD-L1 overexpression in the CSF appears to be more representative of aggressive tumor features than overexpression in the serum. For glioma diagnosis, both serum and CSF sPD-L1 showed significant value in the diagnosis and stratification of glioma, and the best diagnostic performance was obtained with serum sPD-L1 rather than blood-based inflammatory markers. In addition, a descending trend in the level of serum sPD-L1 was observed in postoperative patients. Conclusion: In gliomas, elevated circulating and CSF sPD-L1 levels are associated with aggressive biological activities. The results of the current study suggest that sPD-L1 is a promising biomarker for gliomas that can be used in clinical practice.",

Combined loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (denoted as 1p/19q) has proven to be a powerful predictor of chemotherapeutic response and survival in oligodendrogliomas. We undertook retrospective and prospective studies of brain tumor patients originally diagnosed as oligodendrogliomas or oligoastrocytomas patients followed at our institution using molecular genetic techniques. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes specific for chromosomes 1 and 19 was performed on 22 paraffin-embedded tissues retrospectively; 15 touch-preparation smear samples were studied prospectively; and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) screening was performed on 11 samples with microsatellite markers specific to chromosome 1 and chromosome 19. Of the 37 cases, 24 had 1p/19q, 1 case had 1p only, 2 cases had 19q only, and 10 cases had no deletion. The length of the largest deletion was mapped between markers D1S2795 (1p36.31 locus) and D1S2722 (1p34.2 locus) and between markers D19S416 (19q13.11 locus) and D19S397 (19q13.14 locus), using LOH. All of the pure oligodendrogliomas (n 5 7) harbored 1p/19q. In light of previous findings, the 1p/19q combination appears to be an objective diagnosis marker of classic oligodendrogliomas, one that can be used, in combination with histological examination, to improve the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma.

    "abstract": "Introduction—To report the potential value of pre-operative 18F-FDOPA PET and anatomic  MRI in diagnosis and prognosis of glioma patients. Methods—Forty-five patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioma with pre-operative 18FFDOPA PET and anatomic MRI were retrospectively examined. The volume of contrast  enhancement and T2 hyperintensity on MRI images along with the ratio of maximum 18F-FDOPA  SUV in tumor to normal tissue (T/N SUVmax) were measured and used to predict tumor grade,  molecular status, and overall survival (OS). Results—A significant correlation was observed between WHO grade and: the volume of  contrast enhancement (r=0.67), volume of T2 hyperintensity (r=0.42), and 18F-FDOPA uptake  (r=0.60)(P < 0.01 for each correlation). The volume of contrast enhancement and 18F-FDOPA T/N  SUVmax were significantly higher in glioblastoma (WHO IV) compared with lower grade gliomas (WHO I-III), as well as for high-grade gliomas (WHO III-IV) compared with low-grade gliomas  (WHO I-II). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analyses confirmed the volume of contrast  enhancement and 18F-FDOPA T/N SUVmax could each differentiate patient groups. No significant  differences in 18F-FDOPA uptake were observed by IDH or MGMT status. Multivariable Cox  regression suggested age (HR = 1.16, P = 0.0001) and continuous measures of 18F-FDOPA PET  T/N SUVmax (HR = 4.43, P = 0.016) were significant prognostic factors for OS in WHO I-IV  gliomas. Conclusions—Current findings suggest a potential role for the use of pre-operative 18F-FDOPA  PET in suspected glioma.

    "abstract": "Purpose: A recent report suggests that alterations of  chromosome arms 1p and 19q are associated with  chemotherapeutic response and overall survival in ana plastic oligodendroglioma patients treated with procar bazine, lomustine, and vincristine chemotherapy. We  set out to further clarify the diagnostic and prognostic  implications of these alterations in a broader set of  diffuse gliomas, including astrocytic neoplasms and  low-grade oligodendrogliomas.  Patients and Methods: Fluorescence in situ hybrid ization (FISH) signals from DNA probes mapping to 1p  and 19q common deletion regions were enumerated in  162 diffuse gliomas (79 astrocytomas, 52 oligodendro gliomas, and 31 mixed oligoastrocytomas), collected as  part of an ongoing prospective investigation of CNS  tumors.  Results: The oligodendroglial phenotype was highly  associated with loss of 1p (P 5 .0002), loss of 19q (P <  .0001), and combined loss of 1p and 19q (P < .0001).  Combined loss of 1p and 19q was identifified as a  univariate predictor of prolonged overall survival  among patients with pure oligodendroglioma (log rank, P 5 .03) and remained a signifificant predictor  after adjusting for the effects of patient age and tumor  grade (P < .01). This favorable association was not  evident in patients with astrocytoma or mixed oligoas trocytoma.  Conclusion: Combined loss of 1p and 19q is a statis tically signifificant predictor of prolonged survival in  patients with pure oligodendroglioma, independent of  tumor grade. Given the lack of this association in pa tients with astrocytic neoplasms and the previously  demonstrated chemosensitivity of oligodendrogliomas,  a combined approach of histologic and genotypic as sessment could potentially improve existing strategies  for patient stratifification and management.",

Increased KPNA  levels have been found to predict poor prognosis for a variety  of solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, cervical, and  prostate cancer, and melanoma. The purpose of this study  was to evaluate karyopherin a2 as novel biomarker for  astrocytic gliomas of WHO grades II-IV. We semiquanti tatively measured nuclear expression of karyopherin a2 and  the MIB1 labeling index, by immunohistochemical analysis,  for 94 primary (23 astrocytomas WHO grade II, 24 astro cytomas WHO grade III, 47 glioblastomas) and 12 recurrent  gliomas. In addition, IDH1 mutation status and Nijmegen  breakage syndrome 1 protein expression were assessed, by  immunohistochemical analysis, for all 71 malignant (WHO  grade III and IV) and all 94 primary gliomas, respectively.  Statistical analysis was performed by use of standard tech niques. Karyopherin a2 expression correlated signifificantly  with histological grade (p\\0.001), with proliferative  activity as assessed by the MIB1 index (p\\0.001), with  IDH1 mutation status (p = 0.032), and with Nijmegen break age syndrome 1 protein expression (p = 0.001).

    "abstract": "Background: Serum and tissue concentrations of tumor markers or some metabolites are considered to be helpful in diagnosis and follow-up of the central nervous system (CNS) disease. However, markers currently available are not sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used as actual diagnostic tools. Differentiation between the malignant and benign lesions of the CNS is very important, both for determining the optimum therapeutic approach and to predict morbidity and mortality of the disease. Accurate diagnosis of a malignant disease is mostly performed through a surgical resection and histopathologic evaluation. Free oxygen radicals (FOR) are thought to take part in oncogenesis and cellular differentiation. We explored whether FORs can be used as diagnostic tumor markers. Methods: We investigated the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the serum and tumor tissue of patients with glial tumor. We have studied 30 patients with malign glial tumor (grades III and IVastrocytoma), 30 patients with low grade glial tumor, 28 healthy individuals, and 10 patients with nontumorous lesions (lobectomy for epilepsy). Results: Patients with CNS tumors showed higher serum MDA concentration compared to control groups (epilepsy patients and healthy subjects). These patients had a higher tumor tissue MDA concentration compared to lobectomy tissue from epilepsy patients. Serum and tissue MDA concentrations were also higher in the malignant glial tumor group compared to the low grade glial tumor group. Conclusions: Although not specific, tissue and serum concentrations of FORs can be used as a marker to detect the presence and grade of CNS tumors. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum cutoff value for use of serum and tissue MDA concentrations in brain tumors. ",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumors with poor outcome, and four different molecular subtypes (Mesenchymal, Proneural, Neural, and Classical) are popularly applied in scientific researches and clinics of gliomas. Public databases contain an abundant genome-wide resource to explore the potential biomarker and molecular mechanisms using the informatics analysis. The aim of this study was to discover the potential biomarker and investigate its effect in gliomas. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct the co-expression modules and explore the biomarker among the dataset CGGA mRNAseq_693 carrying 693 glioma samples. Functional annotations, ROC, correlation, survival, univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were implemented to investigate the functional effect in gliomas, and molecular experiments in vitro were performed to study the biological effect on glioma pathogenesis. The brown module was found to be strongly related to WHO grade of gliomas, and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that TNFRSF1A was enriched in MAPK signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway. Overexpressed TNFRSF1A was strongly related to clinical features such as WHO grade, and functioned as an independent poor prognostic predictor of glioma patients. Notably, TNFRSF1A was preferentially upregulated in the Mesenchymal subtype gliomas (Mesenchymal-associated). Knockdown of TNFRSF1A inhibited proliferation and migration of glioma cell lines in vitro. Our findings provide a further understanding of the progression of gliomas, and Mesenchymal-associated TNFRSF1A might be a promising target of diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of gliomas.",

Although there is emerging evidence that some microRNAs are involved in the glioma cell invasion process, it remains necessary to find functional microRNAs and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we reported that a microRNA, miR-383, was downregulated in gliomas and inversely correlated with glioma pathological grades. Downregulation of miR-383 enhanced, whereas upregulation of miR-383 inhibited, the glioma cell invasive ability. Furthermore, we found that downregulation of miR-383 activated the AKT signaling following upregulation of MMP2 expression by directly targeting insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). Importantly, we demonstrated that IGF1R expression is critical for miR-383 downregulation-induced cell invasion.

    "abstract": "Background： Subtelomeric regions dynamically change their epigenetic pattern during development and progression of several malignancies and degenerative disorders. However, DNA methylation of human subtelomeres and their correlation to telomere length (TL) remain undetermined in glioma. Results： Herein, we report on the selective changes in subtelomeric DNA methylation at the end of five  chromosomes (Chr.) (7q, 8q. 18p, 21q, and XpYp) and ascertain their correlation with TL in patients with glioma. Subtelomeric methylation level was invariably higher in glioma patients compared to the control group, irrespective of their age and tumor grade. In particular, a significant increase in methylation was observed at the subtelomericCpG sites of Chr. 8q, 21q, and XpYp in tissues, obtained from the brain tumor of glioma patients. In contrast, no  significant change in methylation was observed at the subtelomere of Chr. 7q and 18p. Selective changes in the subtelomeric methylation level, however, did not show any significant correlation to the global TL. This observedphenomenon was validated in vitro by inducing demethylation in a glioblastoma cell line (SF-767) using 5-azacytidine/ (AZA) treatment. AZA treatment caused significant changes in the subtelomeric methylation pattern but did not alter the TL, which supports our hypothesis. Conclusions： DNA methylation level dramatically increased at the subtelomere of Chr.8q, 21q, and XpYp in malignant   glioma, which could be used as an early epigenetic diagnostic biomarker of the disease. Alterations in subtelomeric methylation, however, have no effects on the TL .",

    "abstract": "Background: BRAF mutation has received a great deal of attention in neuro‐oncology field, recently. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and the clinical significance of BRAFV600E in low‐grade glial tumors. Methods: An institutional cohort of 105 brain tumors (51 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs), 14 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), 12 glioblastoma with neuronal marker expression (GBM‐N), and 28 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs)) from 100 patients were investigated for the presence of BRAFV600E by direct sequencing. Results: We found frequent BRAFV600E in DNTs (26/51, 51%), SEGAs (6/14, 42.9%), and PXAs (14/28, 50%). In DNTs, BRAFV600E was more commonly detected in tumors with extra‐temporal location (68.2% vs. 37.9%; P ¼ 0.032). The diagnostic subgroups of tuberous sclerosis complex were not correlated with BRAFV600E in patients with SEGA (P ¼ 0.533). One PXA case revealed a unique duplication mutation (p.Thr599dup) of codon 599. All GMB‐N cases did not carry BRAF mutation. Conclusions: Our data indicate that BRAFV600E is a common genetic alteration in low‐grade glial tumors with neuronal component or differentiation. High frequency of BRAFV600E in DNTs and SEGAs would be useful in the differential diagnosis, and also offers a potential specific treatment targeting BRAFV600E.",

    "abstract": "Glioma as an aggressive type tumor is rapidly growing and has become one of the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. γ-Glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT) has been shown as a diagnostic marker in various cancers. To reveal whether there is a correlation between GGCT and human glioma, GGCT expression in human glioma tissues and cell lines was first determined. We found that GGCT expression was up-regulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines. Further, we demonstrate that GGCT knockdown inhibits glioma cell T98G and U251 proliferation and colony formation, whereas GGCT overexpression leads to oppose effects. GGCT overexpression promotes the expression of Notch receptors and activates Akt signaling in glioma cells, and Notch-Akt signaling is activated in glioma tissues with high expression of GGCT. Finally, we show that inhibition of Notch-Akt signaling with Notch inhibitor MK-0752 blocks the effects of GGCT on glioma proliferation and colony formation. In conclusion, GGCT plays a critical role in glioma cell proliferation and may be a potential cancer therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Bioinformatics analysis integrating microenvironmental factors and single cell analysis, segregated the glioblastoma (GBM) subtype into three subtypes: proneural, classical and mesenchymal. Mesenchymal GBM tends to have the worst survival rate, but benefits from aggressive treatment protocols. Therefore, it is clinically meaningful to identify relevant biomarkers to distinguish the mesenchymal subtype. Moreover, in developing nations with limited resources, rigorous examinations are costly and inefficient for patient care. Methods: In this study, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas-Glioblastoma (TCGA-GBM) and The Cancer Genome Atlas-Low Grade Glioma (TCGA-LGG) Ribonucleic Acid sequencing (RNAseq) cohorts and confirmed that the mesenchymal subtype was associated with the worst prognosis. Results: We identified periostin (POSTN) as a mesenchymal subtype biomarker with prognostic value across histological grades, and confirmed the reliability of POSTN by gene-expression meta-analysis combining TCGA, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT) GBM cohorts (HR = 1.71 (1.47-2.07), n =693) and LGG cohorts (HR = 2.55 (1.61-4.05), n=1226).

Here, we aimed to characterize a novel anticancer miRNA, miR-625, by investigating its expression, function, and mechanism of action in glioma progression.  The expression of miR-625 and its target mRNA in human glioma tissues and cell lines was assessed by real-time  PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Functional significance was assessed by examining cell cycle  progression, proliferation, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity to temozolomide in vitro, and by examining growth of  subcutaneous glioblastoma in a mouse model in vivo. We found that miR-625 expression was significantly lower  in human glioma samples and cell lines than in normal brain tissue and human astrocytes. Furthermore, miR-625  overexpression not only suppressed glioma cell proliferation in culture and in the tumor xenograft model but also  induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. AKT2 was identified as a direct miR-625 target in glioma cell lines, and  AKT2 overexpression reversed the suppressive effects of miR-625 in the cell lines and the tumor xenograft model.  Finally, we found that the sensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide was increased by miR-625 overexpression, and  this was reversed by concomitant AKT2 expression. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the miR-625-AKT2 axis  could be a new prognostic marker and diagnostic target for gliomas.",

Recurrent mutations in the isocitrate dehydro genase 1 (IDH1) andIDH2genes, which are frequent in gliomas, result in marked accumulation of the metabolic by-product 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) within tumors. In other malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, presence of IDH mutation is associated with elevated 2-HG levels in serum or urine com partments. Circulating 2-HG in patients with glial malignancies has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods. In this study, we analyzed 2-HG levels in the serum and urine of a large set of patients with IDH-mutant and IDH wild-type glioma, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a subset of this cohort. Results. We found that 2-HG was elevated in the urine of patients with IDH-mutant versusIDH-wild-type glioma, although no significant differences in 2-HG levels were observed in the serum or the small set of CSF samples obtained. Among patients with IDH-mutant glioma, 2-HG levels did not differ based on the histopathologic grade, genetic subtype (TP53 mutant or 1p/19q codeleted), presence of a canonical (IDH1 R132H) or non canonical (any other IDH variant) mutation, or treatment type. Conclusion.

    "abstract": "Piwi, highly conserved during evolution, has been reported to play a key role in stem cell self-renewal in several different organisms. As one of the four human homologues of the Piwi family, Hiwi has been demonstrated to be significantly overexpressed in some human cancer. However, the relationship between Hiwi and human gliomas is unclear. In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of Hiwi in human gliomas. Hiwi was found to be specifically expressed in the majority of glioma tissues, and the expression was greatly increased with the ascending of tumor grades. In addition, it was statistically significant that the patients with high Hiwi positive had poorer outcome than the patients with low Hiwi positive. Our results suggest that Hiwi may be a critical factor in glioma progression and could be used as a potential molecular marker for pathological diagnosis and prognosis evaluation for malignant gliomas.",

    "abstract": "  Background: RNA within extracellular vesicles (EVs) have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for  patients with cancer, and are identified in a variety of biofluids. Glioblastomas (GBMs) release  EVs containing RNA into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we describe a multi-institutional study  of RNA extracted from CSF-derived EVs of GBM patients, for the presence of tumor-associated  amplifications and mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Methods: CSF and matching tumor tissue were obtained from patients undergoing resection of  GBMs. We determined wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR) DNA copy number amplification, as well as  wtEGFR and EGFRvIII RNA expression, in tumor samples. We also characterized wtEGFR and  EGFRvIII RNA expression in CSF-derived EVs.  Results: EGFRvIII positive tumors had significantly greater wtEGFR DNA amplification (p=0·02)  and RNA expression (p=0·03), and EGFRvIII positive CSF-derived EVs had significantly more  wtEGFR RNA expression (p=0·004). EGFRvIII was detected in CSF-derived EVs for 14 of the  23 EGFRvIII tissue-positive GBM patients. Conversely, only one of the 48 EGFRvIII tissue negative patients had the EGFRvIII mutation detected in their CSF-derived EVs. These results  yield a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 98% for the utility of CSF-derived EVs to detect an  EGFRvIII-positive GBM.  Conclusions: Our results demonstrate CSF-derived EVs contain RNA signatures reflective of  the underlying molecular genetic status of GBMs in terms of wtEGFR expression and EGFRvIII  status. The high specificity of the CSF-derived EV diagnostic test gives us an accurate  determination of positive EGFRvIII tumor status, and is essentially a less-invasive'liquid biopsy'that might direct mutation-specific therapies for GBMs. ",

However the possible involvement of TFAM in cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we have provided some evidence that TFAM may have a potential role in brain tumor. Western blot analysis with anti-TFAM antibody indicated that TFAM is overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines including U87MG and U251MG. Transcriptome profiling of U87MG and U251MG cells by using deep-sequencing revealed that TFAM transcripts were upregulated in these cells compared to its of cerebral cortex. Confocal microscopic analysis of U251MG cells with anti-TFAM antibody showed that TFAM is located to the dot-like structure close to nucleus, probably mitochondria and endosome. Immunohistochemical analysis of glioma tissue specimens indicated that TFAM is highly upregulated. Bioinformatical analysis with Rembrandt knowledgebase also supported that TFAM mRNA is upregu lated in glioma patients. Taken together, the results presented in this study obviously provided the evidence that TFAM was upregulated in glioma cell line and glioma tissue specimens.

    "abstract": "Background: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive brain tumor associated with a poor prognosis. Plant  homeodomain fnger protein 20 (PHF20) is highly expressed in primary human gliomas and its expression is associated with tumor grade. However, the molecular mechanism by which PHF20 regulates glioblastoma remains poorly  understood. Methods: Genome wide gene expression analysis was performed to identify diferentially expressed genes (DEGs)  in U87 cells with PHF20 gene knockdown. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to  investigate the functions and pathways of DEGs. Pathway-net and signal-net analyses were conducted to identify the  key genes and pathways related to PHF20. Results: Expression of 540 genes, including FEN1 and CCL3, were signifcantly altered upon PHF20 gene silencing.  GO analysis results showed that DEGs were signifcantly enriched in small molecule metabolic and apoptotic processes. Pathway analysis indicated that DEGs were mainly involved in cancer and metabolic pathways. The MAPK,  apoptosis and p53 signaling pathways were identifed as the hub pathways in the pathway network, while PLCB1,  NRAS and PIK3 s were hub genes in the signaling network. Conclusions: Our fndings indicated that PHF20 is a pivotal upstream regulator. It afects the occurrence and development of glioma by regulating a series of tumor-related genes, such as FEN1, CCL3, PLCB1, NRAS and PIK3s, and  activation of apoptosis signaling pathways. Therefore, PHF20 might be a novel biomarker for early diagnosis, and a  potential target for glioblastoma therapies.",

    "abstract": "Aims The zinc finger transcription factor WT1 is expressed in astrocytic neoplasms and therefore is a potential target of immunotherapy in brain tumours. Our aim was to further elucidate the role of WT1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in neuropathology, particularly as to the differentiation of astrocytoma from oligodendroglioma as well as to the dependency of WT1 expression on clinically relevant parameters. Methods 829 evaluable brain tumour samples were investigated by WT1 immunohistochemistry on full tissue routine slides, consisting of 442 glioblastomas, 303 astrocytomas, 41 oligodendrogliomas and 43 oligoastrocytomas. In addition public WT1 gene expression data of 351 gliomas were analysed. Results Our data show that WT1 expression in diffuse astrocytic tumours increases with WHO tumour grade and is associated with older age, absence of IDH1 mutation but not related to O(6)- methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Univariable, but not multivariable survival analysis indicates that WT1 expression is associated with worse outcome in patients with diffuse astrocytoma but not glioblastoma. Conclusions The significant WT1 expression differences between diffuse astrocytomas, oligoastrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, which are also present in the Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data, National Cancer Institute (REMBRANDT, 2005, http://rembrandt.nci.nih.gov) gene database set, provide a rationale for use of WT1 as part of a routine immunohistochemistry panel.",

    "abstract": "Background: Clinically useful tumor markers have yet to be identified for malignant glioma.We report on two potential novel tumor markers, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and recoverin (protein A). VEGF is a highly specific endothelial cell activator that induces angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Our study was designed to assess whether VEGF could be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with cerebral neoplasms and used as a marker of particular tumors. We also studied serum recoverin levels in patients with various brain tumors and compared these to controls. Recoverin is a detectable serologic protein that is expressed in patients with cancer-associated retinopathy, a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Methods: In the VEGF arm, we used a solid-phase ELISA to determine the levels of VEGF. CSF samples from patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and with metastatic and nonastrocytic brain tumors were compared with nontumor control samples. In our recoverin study, an immunoenzymetric assay was used to measure the serum recoverin levels patients with glioma and compared with controls.  Results: In the VEGF arm, 89% of samples with malignant astrocytoma and 27% of nonastrocytoma samples had detectable levels of VEGF. VEGF was not detectable in normal CSF samples. The levels of VEGF were significantly higher in high-grade astrocytomas than in nonastrocytic tumors. Recoverin levels were 10-fold higher in patients with recurrent GBM relative to controls. In patients with low-grade glioma, anaplastic glioma, and GBM with no evidence of recurrence, a 3- to 5-fold increase was observed.  Conclusions: VEGF is detectable in CSF and may be a potential marker for differentiating astrocytic from nonastrocytic tumors.

It has been discovered that highly stable extracellular miRNAs circulate in the blood of both healthy individuals and patients. miRNAs in serum of patients with GBM and normal controls were analyzed by microarray analysis. The relevant bioinformatic analysis of the predicted target genes (gene ontology, pathway, gene network analysis) were performed. The miRNA microarray reveals differentially expressed miRNAs in serum between the GBM and normal controls. Of the 752 miRNAs, 115 miRNAs were upregulated in the GBM group, and 24 miRNAs were downregulated (fold change 2.0, P<0.01).

However, the expression pattern of HAUSP in glioma patients is still unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern and prognostic significance of HAUSP in patients with glioma. Eighty glioma specimens and 10 normal control samples were obtained. Immunohistochemical assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis were carried out to explore the expression of HAUSP. Additionally, the association of HAUSP expression with clinicopathological parameters and the survival of glioma patients were analyzed. Our results showed that HAUSP expression levels were increased from grade I to grade IV in the tumors of the glioma patients. Moreover, the survival rate of patients with HAUSP-positive tumors was lower when compared to that of patients with HAUSP-negative tumors. We further confirmed that high expression of HAUSP was a significant and independent prognostic indicator in glioma by multivariate analysis. Our data provide convincing evidence for the first time that the overexpression of HAUSP at the gene and protein levels is correlated with poor outcome in patients with glioma in China.

    "abstract": "Metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) has been regarded as a novel potential therapeutic target for multiple cancers. However, the impact of MACC1 in glioma remains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of MACC1 expression with the clinicopathological features of glioma. MACC1 mRNA and protein expression levels in human glioma tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry assays, respectively. MACC1 mRNA and protein expression were both significantly higher in glioma tissues than in corresponding noncancerous brain tissues (both P < 0.001). In addition, statistical analysis suggested that high MACC1 expression was significantly correlated with advanced pathological grade (P=0.004) and that patients with high expression of MACC1 protein exhibited a poorer prognosis than those with low MACC1 expression. Furthermore, Cox multivariate analysis showed that MACC1 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting the overall survival of glioma patients. In conclusion, expression of MACC1 in glioma could be adopted as a candidate biomarker for the diagnosis of clinical stage and for assessing prognosis, indicating for the first time that MACC1 may play an important role in the tumor development and progression in glioma. MACC1 might be considered as a novel therapeutic target against this cancer. ",

    "abstract": "We previously reported to identify SOX5 as a glioma antigen by serological screening using a testis cDNA library. The present study was designed to analyze SOX5 expression, its immunoreactivity, and the correlation between SOX5 IgG responses and clinical features in glioma patients to evaluate the possibility of its use as a diagnostic marker. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that SOX5 was expressed in glioma tissues, but not in normal adult tissues, except in the testis. An immunohistochemical analysis showed that SOX5 was expressed in glioma cells, but only a few SOX5-positive cells were detected in non-neoplastic tissues from the cerebral cortex. IgG antibodies against SOX5 were detected in sera from 8 of the 27 glioma patients (27.6%), 0 of the 14 patients with other brain diseases (0%), 1 of the 54 other cancer patients (1.9%) and 1 of the 37 healthy individuals (2.7%). Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who showed IgG responses against SOX5 exhibited significantly better survival periods than GBM patients without SOX5 antibodies. In summary, SOX5 is aberrantly expressed in glioma and can be recognized as a glioma antigen using IgGs from the sera of glioma patients. Furthermore, there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of SOX5 IgGs and survival in GBM patients, suggesting that the glioma antigen SOX5 may be useful not only as a diagnostic marker, but also as a prognositic marker in glioma patients.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Biomarkers can facilitate diagnosis, monitor treatment response, and assess prognosis in some patients with cancer. YKL-40 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are two proteins highly differentially expressed by malignant gliomas.We obtained prospective longitudinal serum samples from patients with gliomas to determine whether YKL-40 or MMP-9 could be used as serum markers. Experimental Design: Serum samples were obtained concurrently with magnetic resonance imaging scans. YKL-40 and MMP-9 were determined by ELISA and the values correlated with the patient's radiographic status and survival. Results: High-grade glioma patients who underwent a surgical resection of their tumor had transient increase of bothYKL-40 and MMP-9 serum levels in the postoperative period. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients with no radiographic evidence of disease (n = 10 patients,50 samples) had a significantly lower level ofYKL-40 and MMP-9 than patients with active tumor (n = 66 patients, 209 samples; P = 0.0003 and 0.0002, respectively). Anaplastic glioma patients with no radiographic evidence of disease (n = 32 patients, 107 samples) also had a significantly lower level of YKL-40 compared with those patients with active tumor (n = 48 patients, 199 samples; P = 0.04). There was a significant inverse association between YKL-40 and survival in GBM, hazard ratio (hazard ratio, 1.4; P = 0.02), and anaplastic astrocytoma patients (hazard ratio, 2.2; P = 0.05). Conclusions: YKL-40 and MMP-9 can be monitored in patients' serum and help confirm the absence of active disease in GBM andYKL-40 in anaplastic glioma patients.YKL-40 can be used as predictor of survival in patients with high-grade glioma.

To date, the relationship  between GATAD1 amplification and glioma oncogenesis and malignancy is still  unknown. Methods: GATAD1 gene amplification and expression were analyzed in 187 gliomas using qPCR and immunostaining. The relation of GATAD1 to patients' prognoses was assessed via the Kaplan-Meier method. The MTT and orthotopic tumor  transplantation assays were used to identify the function of GATAD1 in glioma proliferation. cDNA microarray, ChIP qPCR, EMSA and 3C were used to screen the  downstream mechanism of GATAD1 regulating glioma proliferation. Results: Our results indicated that GATAD1 gene amplification and GATAD1 gene  expression are novel independent diagnosis biomarkers to indicate poor outcome of  glioma patients. GATAD1 knockdown can remarkably suppress GBM cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. GATAD1 could promote CCND1 gene transcription  by inducing long range chromatin architectural interaction on the CCND1 promoter.  Then GATAD1  sequentially accelerates GBM cell cycle transition and proliferation via regulating CCND1.

Characterization of the sugar chains was achieved with the use of a combinationof HPLC columns and a highly sensitive fluorescence detector  at femtomole levels. By collecting peaks which accounted for 0.1% or more, sixteen different oligosaccharide structures  were characterized from glioblastoma tissuc and cell lines. The 16 oligosaccharide structures accounted for 48.9% of the total N-linked oligosaccharides present in glioblastoma tissue.

Expression of  highly branched tetra-antennary N-glycans that are usually  detected in lungs or hepatocellular cancer was not observed. Tissue glioma cells and cultured cells also displayed strong LCA-lectin binding, which binds to sugar chains with core fucose (including A2G2F), while normal brain tissue did not.

    "abstract": "Glioma is the most aggressive brain tumor with high invasiveness and poor prognosis. More reliable, sensitive and practical biomarkers to reveal glioma high invasiveness remain to be explored for the guidance of therapy. We herein evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) in the glioma specimens from  237 patients, and found that ADLH1A1 was frequently overexpressed in the high-grade glioma (WHO grade III-IV) as compared to the low-grade glioma (WHO grade I-II) patients. The tumor cells with ALDH1A1 expression were more abundant in the region between tumor and the borderline of adjacent tissue as compared to the central part of the tumor. ALDH1A1 overexpression was associated with poor differentiation and dismal prognosis. Notably, the overall and disease-free survivals of the patients who had ALDH1A1+ tumor cells sparsely located in the adjacent tissue were much worse. Furthermore, ALDH1A1 expression was correlated with the \"classical-like\" (CL) subtype as we examined GBM specimens from 72 patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that ALDH1A1 was an independent marker for glioma patients' outcome. Mechanistically, both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that ALDH1A1+ cells isolated from either a glioblastoma cell line U251 or primary glioblastoma cells displayed significant invasiveness, clonogenicity, and proliferation as compared to ALDH1A- cells, due to increased levels of mRNA and protein for matrix metalloproteinase 2, 7 and 9 (MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9). These results indicate that ALDH1A1+ cells contribute to the progression of glioma including invasion, proliferation and poor prognosis, and suggest that targeting ALDH1A1 may have important implications for the treatment of highly invasive glioma.",

    "abstract": "Background： The rapid progress of proteomics over the past years has allowed the discovery of a large number of  potential biomarker candidates to improve early tumor diagnosis and therapeutic response, thus being further integrated into clinical environment. High grade gliomas represent one of the most aggressive and treatment-resistant   types of human brain cancer, with approximately 9-12 months median survival rate for patients with grade IV glioma  (glioblastoma). Using state-of-the-art proteomics technologies, we have investigated the proteome profile for glioblastoma patients in order to identify a novel protein biomarker panel that could discriminate glioblastoma patients from controls  and increase diagnostic accuracy. Results： In this study, SELDHToF MS technology was used to screen potential protein patterns in glioblastoma patients  serum； furthermore, LC-MS/MS technology was applied to identify the candidate biomarkers peaks. Through these  proteomic approaches, three proteins S100A8, 5100A9 and CXCL4 were selected as putative biomarkers and confirmed   by ELISA. Next step was to validate the above mentioned molecules as biomarkers through identification of protein  expression by Western blot in tumoral versus peritumoral tissue. Conclusions： Proteomic technologies have been used to investigate the protein profile of glioblastoma patients and  established several potential dlagnostic biomarkers. While it is unlikely for a single biomarker to be highly effective for glioblastoma diagnostic, our data proposed an altemative and efficient approach by using a novel combination of| multiple biomnarkers.

    "abstract": "Objective: Glioblastoma(GBM)is the most common primary malignant neoplasm of the central nervous system (CNS).Despite the progress in therapeutic strategies such as surgical techniques, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, prognosis and therapeutically convenient monitoring tools in patients with GBM has not improved significantly up to now. Therefore, exosomal miRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers having high sensitivity and specificity are required to improve diagnosis and to develop new targeted therapy strategies for GBM patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate a novel miRNA signature asa predictive biomarker for diagnosis and measurement of response to therapeutic interventions in plasma of GBM patients versus traumatic brain injury and diffuse low-grade astrocytoma(LGA) patients.  Patients and methods: Plasma exosomal-microRNAs were isolated from GBM(n=25),LGA(n=25), and head trauma patients (n=15)as non-glioma control from March 2017 to June 2018 in Department of Neurosurgery at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital. Through a bioinformatics analysis, we used Miranda, Target Scan, mirBase, DIANA-microT-CDS, and KEGG database as well asmicroarray data analysis from GEO for microRNA candidates. Finally, miR-210, miR-185, miR-5194, and miR-449 were selected among those miRNAs because they were recorded to target the maximum number of genes in EGFR and c-MET signaling pathways. Then, exosomal microRNAs were extracted from plasma of patients and quantitated by locked nucleic acid real-time PCR in GBM, LGA, and trauma patients.  Results: This result is the first report on the role of circulating miR-185, miR-449, and miR-5194 in GBM compared to LGA and trauma. The plasma expression of miR-210 as an oncogenic miR was upregulated in GBM and LGA groups (P< 0.0001). Otherwise, miR-185, miR-5194, and miR-449 were significantly downregulated(P0.05) in GBM and LGA compared to trauma patients. There was no significant downregulation in the expression of miR-185 between GBM and LGA, while the expression of miR-5194 (P0.05)and miR-449(P0.05) was significantly decreased in GBM patients compared with LGA.  Conclusions: These results indicate that the levels of miR-210, miR-449, and miR-5194 are a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker positively correlated with histopathological grade and invasiveness of GBM. These findings imply that circulating microRNA can be potentially used as novel biomarkers for glioma that might be beneficial in clinical management of glioma patients.",

    "abstract": " CD150 (IPO3/SLAM) belongs to the SLAM family of receptors and serves as a major entry receptor for measles virus. CD150 is expressed on normal and malignant cells of the immune system. However, little is known about its expression outside the hematopoietic system, especially tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Although CD150 was not  found in different regions of normal brain tissues, our immunohistochemical study revealed  its expression in 77.6% of human CNS tumors, including glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocyto-  ma, diffuse astrocytoma, ependymoma, and others. CD150 was detected in the cytoplasm, but not on the cell surface of glioma cell lines, and it was colocalized with the endoplasmic  reticulum and Golgi complex markers. In addition to the full length mRNA of the mCD150  splice isoform, in glioma cells we found a highly expressed novel CD150 transcript (nCD150), containing an 83 bp insert. The insert is derived from a previously unrecognized exon designated Cyt-new, which is located 510 bp downstream of the transmembrane region exon, and is a specific feature of primate SLAMF1. Both mCD150 and nCD150 cDNA  variants did not contain any mutations and had the leader sequence. The nCD150 transcript  was also detected in normal and malignant B lymphocytes, primary T cells, dendritic cells  and macrophages； however, in glioma cells nCD150 was found to be the predominant CD150 isoform. Similarly to mCD150, cell surface expression of nCD150 allows wild typemeasles virus entry to the cell. Our data indicate that CD150 expression in CNS tumors can  be considered a new diagnostic marker and potential target for novel  therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a most common type of primary brain tumors. Extracellular vesicles, in the form of exosomes, are known to mediate cell-cell communication by transporting cell-derived proteins and nucleic acids, including various microRNAs (miRNAs). Here we examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with recurrent glioma for the levels of cancer-related miRNAs, and evaluated the values for prognosis by comparing the measures of CSF-, serum-, and exosome-contained miR-21 levels. Samples from seventy glioma patients following surgery were compared with those from brain trauma patients as a non-tumor control group. Exosomal miR-21 levels in the CSF of glioma patients were found significantly higher than in the controls; whereas no difference was detected in serum-derived exosomal miR-21 expression. The CSF derived exosomal miR-21 levels correlated with tumor spinal/ventricle metastasis and the recurrence with anatomical site preference. From additional 198 glioma tissue samples, we verified that miR-21 levels associated with tumor grade of diagnosis and negatively correlated with the median values of patient overall survival time. We further used a lentiviral inhibitor to suppress miR-21 expression in U251 cells. The results showed that the levels of miR-21 target genes of PTEN, RECK and PDCD4 were up-regulated at protein levels. Therefore, we concluded that the exosomal miR-21 levels could be demonstrated as a promising indicator for glioma diagnosis and prognosis, particularly with values to predict tumor recurrence or metastasis.",

Gene expression data from candoxin-treated human glioma  (Hs 683) cells were downloaded from the Gene Expression  Omnibus database (accession number, GSE1682), from a  12-time-point set of samples. Differentially expressed genes  were screened between control and candoxin-treated samples  at different time-points, and three time-specific gene sets and  CDGs were identified. All genes were subject to pathway  enrichment analysis to gain further insight into gene function.  CDGs were clustered based upon their original expression  between 0 and 48 h, and, from this subset, feature genes  were selected. Small molecules associated with candoxin  were identified by comparing the expression pattern of the  most valid candidate genes with that of differential genes  exposed to small molecules in the Connectivity Map. From the  12-, 24- and 48-h time-points, 746, 265 and 539 differentially expressed genes were identified, respectively. A total  of 129 genes were differentially expressed and significantly  enriched in focal adhesion and gap junction pathways. From  these, 11 feature genes and one marker gene (EPS8L1) were  identified. Four small molecules that were most relevant to  candoxin action were identified. In conclusion, it is hypothesized that candoxin stimulation can cause glial inflammation  through mutations in cell adhesion activity.

This study presents the implementation of a methodology capable of overcoming the visual challenges of fluorescent microscopy for diagnostic neuropathology by using automated digital image analysis, with long term goal of providing unbiased quantitative analyses of multiplexed biomarkers for solid tissue neuropathology. In this study, we validated PTBP1, a putative biomarker for glioma, and tested the extent to which immunofluorescent microscopy combined with automated and unbiased image analysis would permit the utility of PTBP1 as a biomarker to distinguish diagnostically challenging surgical biopsies. As a paradigm, we utilized second resections from patients diagnosed either with reactive brain changes (pseudoprogression) and recurrent glioblastoma (true progression). Our image analysis workflow was capable of removing background autofluorescence and permitted quantification of DAPI-PTBP1 positive cells. PTBP1-positive nuclei, and the mean intensity value of PTBP1 signal in cells. Traditional pathological interpretation was unable to distinguish between groups due to unacceptably high discordance rates amongst expert neuropathologists.

Plexin-B1 is abundantly expressed in the nervous system as an axonal guidance moleculle during neuronal development. However, the correlation between its expression and the clinical characteristics of gliomas, and its therapeutic significance, remain  largely unexplored. In this study, we detected the expression of Plexin-B1 in clinical glioma tissue samples. Plexin-B1 was highly expressed in the cytoplasm and on the membrane of glioma tissues, while only trace levels of Plexin-B1 were present in normal brain tissue. The expression level of Plexin-B1 in glioma tissue was associated with the pathological grade of the glioma. In addition, we used flow cytometry to analyze  the expression of Plexin-B1 in glioma cell lines and its ligand, semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), in natural killer(NK) cell lines. Cytotoxicity assays showed cytolysis of the U251 glioma cell line by the NK cell line, NK92, and this was markedly downregulated when the neutralizing antibody to Plexin-B1 was added. This study demonstrates that Plexin-B1 could be used as a diagnostic biomarker, and also suggests that it may be involved in the cytotoxicity of NK cells to glioma cells. Plexin-B1 could be a useful future target for glioma immunotherapy. ",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, can induce mRNA degradation or repress translation by binding to the 3-! untranslated region (UTR) of its target mRNA. Recently, some  specific miRNAs, e.g. miR-93, have been found to be involved in pathological processes by targeting some oncogenes or tumor suppressors in glioma. Hawever, the regulatory mechanism of miR-93 in the biological behaviors and chemoresistance of glioma  cells remains unclear. In the present study, in situ hybridization and real-timeRT-PCR data indicated that miR-93 was significantly  upregulated in glioma patients (n=43) compared with normal brain tissues  (n=8). Moreover, the  upregulated miR-93 level was  significantly associated with the advanced malignancy. We also  found that upregulation of miR-93 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells, and that miR.93 was  involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression by mediating the  protein levels of P21, P27, P53 and Cyclin D1. P21 was further  identified as a direct target of miR-93. Knockdown of P21 attenuated the suppressive effects of miR-93 inhibition on cell cycle progression and colony formation. In addition, inhibition of miR-93 enhanced the chemosensitization of glioma cells to temozolomide (TMZ). Based on  these above data, our study demonstrates that miR-93, upregulated in  glioma, promotes the proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration  and invasionof human glioma cells and suppresses their chemosensitivity to TMZ. Therefore, miR-93 may  become a  promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target tor glioma.",

However, the technique cannot be applied in those glioma patients with concomitant neurological dysfunctions or advanced age. The present study aimed to find a new minimally invasive and efficient alternative method for the detection of MGMT promoter methylation. The expression of MGMT promoter methylation was assessed in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid(CSF), and compared to the corresponding tumor tissue from glioma patients. The 89 patients in the study [32 World Health Organization (WHO) grade II, 19 WHO grade III and 38 WHO grade IV) were pathologically-diagnosed glioma and received radiation therapy following sample collection. The resected glioma tumor tissue(89), corresponding serum(89) and CSF(78) samples were collected for the detection of MGMT promoter methylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting MGMT promoter methylation in CSF and serum were compared. Among the tumor tissue samples, 51/89(57.3%) showed MGMT promoter methylation. The specificity of the detection in the CSF and serum samples reached 100%. The sensitivity of MGMT promoter methylation detection in CSF and serum were 26/40(65.0%) and 19/51(37.3%),respectively(P<0.05). In the WHOI I, III and IV subgroups, the sensitivities of MGMT promoter methylation detection using CSF were 8/12(66.7%), 11/18(61.1%) and 7/10(70.0%), respectively, which were significantly higher than the sensitivities using serum(7/21,33.3%; 7/19,36.8%; and 5/11,45.5%, respectively P<0.05). Among patients with residual postoperative tumors, the sensitivities of detecting MGMT promoter methylation using CSF and serum were 18/25(72.0%) and 10/24(41.7%), respectively, both of which were significantly higher than the corresponding values for patients without residual tumors(8/15,53.3% and 6/19,31.6%, respectively; P<0.05). The detection of MGMT promoter methylation in CSF specimens shows higher sensitivity compared to the serum for glioma patients.

    "abstract": "The minichromosome maintenance (MCM)  proteins, which play an important role in eukaryotic DNA  replication, represent a group of proteins that are currently  under investigation as novel diagnostic tumor markers. Several  studies have proved a greater reliability of MCM proteins to  stain proliferating cells compared to Ki67 protein, a routinely  used proliferation marker in histopathology. In the present  study, the expressions of MCM7 and Ki67 were estimated in  66 primary human astrocytomas in relation to tumor grade  (Grade I-IV, WHO). MCM7 significantly stained more nuclei  compared to Ki67 in all the histopathological grades  investigated. In addition, a stronger increase of the MCM7  labelling index, in relation to the tumor aggressiveness, was  observed.  Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins represent  a protein family, MCM2 to MCM7, which forms  heterohexameric complexes at the replication origin during  eukaryotic DNA duplication, licensing DNA replication  (1). This makes MCM proteins attractive as histological  markers (2), supported by increasing evidence of a better  correlation between MCM7 expression and proliferating  cells compared to Ki67 in many tumors (3-8).  Astrocytic tumors comprise a wide range of  neuroectodermal tumors that differ in growth potential,  extent of invasiveness, morphological features, tendency for  progression and clinical outcome (9). According to WHO  classification, these tumors are distinguished in pilocytic  astrocytoma (PA; WHO grade I), diffuse astrocytoma (DA;  WHO grade II), anaplastic atrocytoma (AA; WHO grade  III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade IV).  In a recent study (10) we assessed the utility of MCM7  protein as a marker of proliferation in glioblastoma.  Additional evidence of the importance of MCM in  astrocytoma proliferation measurement comes from the  work of Scott et al. (11), who investigated astrocytomas  grade II to IV.  Our study aims to compare the immunohistochemical  staining patterns of Ki67 and MCM7 in the complete  staging of astrocytoma, from grade I to grade IV (WHO), comprising a significant number of benign pilocytic astrocytomas.",

EVs were isolated by DEP chip and subjected to on-chip immunofuorescence (IF) staining to  determine the concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Tau. EVs were analyzed from the  plasma samples isolated from independent patient cohorts. Glioblastoma cell lines secrete EVs enriched  for GFAP and Tau.

Sixty-five percent (11/17) of brain tumor  patients showed higher EV-GFAP than the maximum observed in controls.

    "abstract": "Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most aggressive cancers with a poor prognosis in spite of a plethora of established diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and treatment  modalities. Therefore, the current goal is the detection of novel biomarkers, possibly detectable in the blood of GBM patients that may enable an early diagnosis and are potential therapeutic targets, leading to more efficient interventions.      Experimental Procedures MicroRNA profiling of 734 human and human-associated viral miRNAs was performed on     blood plasma samples from 16 healthy Individuals and 16 patients with GBM, using the    nCounter miRNA Expression Assay Kits.      Results We identified 19 miRNAs with significantly different plasma levels in GBM patients, com- pared to the healthy individuals group with the difference limited by a factor of 2. Additionally, 11 viral miRNAs were found differentially expressed in plasma of GBM patients and 24    miRNA levels significantly correlated with the patients survival. Moreover, the overlap between the group of candidate miRNAs for diagnostic biomarkers and the group of miRNAs   associated with survival, consisted of ten miRNAs, showing both diagnostic and prognostic potential. Among them, hsa miR 592 and hsa miR 514a 3p have not been previously described in GBM and represent novel candidates for selective biomarkers. The possible signaling, induced by the revealed miRNAs is discussed, including those of viral origin, and in particular those related to the impaired immune response in the progression of GBM.    Conclusion  The GBM burden is reflected in the alteration of the plasma miRNAs pattern, including viral miRNAs, representing the potential for future clinical application.

The purpose of our study was to assess the expression pattern of GFAP-S in spinal cord  astrocytomas in human patients and to evaluate the utility of GFAP-S as an immunohistochemical diagnostic marker. A total of 22 patients with spinal cord astrocytic tumors were included in this study. Patients were classified according to the WHO designation of human astrocytic tumors； three patients had grade 1 astrocytomas, 14 had  grade 2, and five had Grade 3. Normal control spinal cord tissues were obtained at autopsy from the cervical spinal cords of ten patients with no history of cervical trauma or neurological disease. We evaluated BRAF, IDH1, GFAP, and GFAP-S immunoreactivity in control tissues and astrocytomas. In normal control tissues, GFAP immunoreactivity was detected in astrocytes whereas GFAP-S immunoreactivity was observed in very few astrocytes  adjacent to the subpial layer of the spinal cord. GFAP-S immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with spinal  cord astrocytoma grade in astrocytomas compared to that in normal control tissues. The optical density of GFAP-S increased significantly with astrocytoma grade (correlation  coefficient, R² = 0.680). Also, BRAF and IDH1 immunoreactivity were detected in astrocytoma.

    "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are the most common and lethal primary intracranial tumors. To date, no reliable bio- markers for the detection and risk stratification of gliomas have been identified. Recently, we demonstrated significant levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) to be present  in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with  primary CNS lymphoma. Because of the involvement of miRNA in carcinogenesis, miRNAs in CSF may  serve as unique biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis of glioma. The objective of this pilot study was to  identify differentially expressed microRNAs in CSF  samples from patients with glioma as potential novel  glioma biomarkers. With use of a candidate approach of miRNA quantification by reverse-transcriptase poly- merasc chain reaction (qRT-PCR), miRNAs with significant levels in CSF samples from patients with gliomas were identified. MiR-15b and miR-21 were differentially expressed in CSF samples from patients with gliomas,  compared to control subjects with various neurologic disorders, including patients with primary CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous brain metastases. Receiver- opcrating  characteristic analysis of miR-15b level  revealed an area under the curve of 0.96 in discriminating patients with glioma from patients without glioma. Moreover, inclusion of miR-15b and miR-21  in combined expression analyses resulted in an increased diagnostic accuracy with 90% sensitivity and 100%  specificity to distinguish patients  with glioma from control subjects and patients with primary CNS lymphoma. In conclusion, the results of this pilot study  demonstrate that miR-15b and miR-21 are markers for gliomas, which can be assessed in the CSF by means of qRT-PCR. Accordingly, miRNAs in the CSF have the potential to serve as novel biomarkers for the detection of gliomas.",

    "abstract": "An immunohistochemical method for assessing cell cycle phase distribution in neurosurgical biopsies would enable such data to be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for the estimation of prognosis and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in glial neoplasms, without the requirement for flow cytometric analysis. Paraffin-embedded sections of intracerebral gliomas (n = 48), consisting of diffuse astrocytoma (n = 9), anaplastic astrocytoma(n = 8) and glioblastoma (n = 31), were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using markers of cell cycle entry, Mcm-2 and Ki67, and putative markers of cell cycle phase, cyclins D1 (G1-phase), cyclin A (S-phase), cyclin B1 (G2-phase) and phosphodiester H3 (Mitosis). Double labelling confocal microscopy confirmed that the phase markers were infrequently expressed. Cell cycle estimations by immunohistochemistry were corroborated by flow cytometric analysis. There was a significant increase in Mcm-2 (P < 0.0001), Ki67 (P < 0.0001), cyclin A (P < 0.0001)and cyclin B1 (P = 0.002) expression with increasing grade from diffuse astrocytoma through anaplastic astrocytoma to glioblastoma, suggesting that any of these four markers has potential as a marker of tumor grade. In a subset of glioblastomas (n = 16) for which accurate clinical follow-up data were available, there was a suggestion that the cyclin A:Mcm-2 labelling fraction might predict relatively favorable response to radical radiotherapy. These provisional findings, however, require confirmation by a larger study. We conclude that it is feasible to obtain detailed cell cycle data by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue biopsies.

However, the prognosis of the disease remains poor. Explorations of the underlying mechanisms of glioma and identification of effective markers for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication remain important today. In this study, we employed survival analysis to determine that TPM3 overexpression was significantly associated with high-grade gliomas and higher mortality. Using microarray combined with Pearson correlation analysis, we found that TPM3 was positively correlated with the expression of MMP family members and EMT-like activators. Reduction of TPM3 (via TPM3-siRNA) inhibited cellular invasion and migration and decreased MMP-9 and SNAI1 levels in glioma cells. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show that TPM3 plays a critical role in the progression of gliomas and provides novel insights into the key roles of MMP family members and EMT-like activators that mediate TPM3 functional signaling for glioma regulation.

    "abstract": "Objective: The uptake of e-methyl -I lC-methionine (MET) by gliomas is greater than that by intact tissue, making methionine very useful for evaluation of tumor extent. If the degree of malignancy of brain tumors can be evaluated by MET-PET, the usefulness of MET-PET as a means of diagnosing brain tumors will increase. Methods: We performed this study on 67 glioma patients between 3 and 69 years of age (36 males and 31 females). Tumors included diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma, medulloblastoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, choroid plexus papilloma, central neurocytoma, optic glioma, gliomatosis cerebri, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and ganglioglioma. Tumor activity and degree of malignancy were evaluated using Ki-67LI (LI: labeling index) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The correlations between methionine uptake and tumor proliferation (tumor versus contralateral gray matter ratio (T/N) and Ki-67LI) were determined for the group of all subjects. The existence of significant correlations between T/N and Ki-67LI and between SUV and Ki-67LI was determined for astrocytic tumors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of T/N and standardized uptake value (SUV) was performed for the group of astrocytic tumors. We also determined the ROC cut-off levels to ensure high accuracy of the analysis. Results: For the 67 cases of glioma, the degree of accumulation was variable. Ki-67LI differed significantly between the high-grade group and low-grade group at T/N levels between 1.5 and 1.8 on analysis using tumor proliferative potential (p = 0.019-0.031). The prognosis differed significantly between the highgrade and low-grade groups when T/N was in the range of 1.6-1.8 (p = 0.028-0.032). The accuracy thus calculated was highest (85.7%) when T/N was 1.5 as determined by ROC analysis. Conclusions: When analysis was confined to cases of astrocytic tumor, a correlation was noted between methionine accumulation and Ki-67LI. For the astrocytic tumors, T/N ratio seemed to be more useful as a diagnostic indicator than SUV. The cut-off level of T/N ratio for distinction between high-grade and low-grade astrocytoma appears to lie between 1.5 and 1.6.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing molecular biomarkers using blood is an important approach for clinical assessment of malignant glioma. We investigated a molecular proteomic biomarker based approach for glioblastoma using patients blood samples. The expression levels of a list of candidate proteins were quantified in plasma and serum samples from two different cohorts of patients with malignant glioma and normal controls. The biological function was studied for one of the identified markers. Additionally, the prognostic significance of protein marker expression was measured by survival analysis. As a result, protein biomarkers associated with malignant glioma were identified from the blood specimens and five of the protein biomarkers were common to both cohorts. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that many of the protein biomarkers identified in peripheral blood specimens were expressed in malignant gliomas. Staining levels for one of the biomarkers, MIP-1α, was found to correlate with WHO grade among invasive gliomas, and we demonstrate that MIP-1α promotes human glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, four prognostic protein biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, we demonstrate that both peripheral blood plasma and serum specimens are highly valuable and complementary to each other in the quest for protein biomarkers of malignant glioma. Sets of novel protein biomarkers were identified that may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with malignant glioma.",

    "abstract": "Human glioma is a pernicious tumor from the central nervous system; it has been reported that microRNAs (miRs) may have carcinogenic or tumor suppressor effects on human glioma. The aim of the present study was to assess miR-141 expression and functional role in human primary glioma, as well as in tumor-derived cell lines. The expression of miR-141 in primary human glioma tissues and cell lines was assessed by employing reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Next, its role in cellular growth, migration, invasion and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) regulation was determined using various in vitro and in vivo assays, and on the identification its target gene(s) using luciferase assays. The results demonstrated that miR-141 expression was downregu- lated, and Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) was upregulated in the primary human gliomas and human glioma-derived cell lines tested. In addition, a negative correlation existed between miR-141 and EphA2 expression levels in glioma grades II, III and IV. Furthermore, exogenous miR-141 expression resulted in decreased proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro. It was also revealed that exogenous miR-141 expression resulted in in vivo inhibi-tion of tumor growth and inhibition of the development of VM. Finally, the present study successfully confirmed that EphA2 was a direct target of miR-141 in glioma-derived cells using luciferase assays. Based on these results, it was concluded that miR-141 may regulate cell proliferation, migration, invasion and VM formation by controlling EphA2 expression; also, its  target EphA2 may be a novel diagnostic/prognostic biomarker  and a potential anti-VM therapeutic target.",

However, the diagnostic criteria, in particular for oligoastrocytoma, are highly subjective. The aim of our study was to establish genetic profiles for diffuse gliomas and to estimate their predictive impact. In this study, we screened 360 World Health Organization grade II gliomas for mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 genes and for 1p/19q loss and correlated these with clinical outcome. Most tumors (86%) were characterized genetically by TP53 mutation plus IDH1/2 mutation (32%), 1p/19q loss plus IDH1/2 mutation (37%), or IDH1/2 mutation only (17%). TP53 mutations only or 1p/19q loss only was rare (2 and 3%, respectively). The median survival of patients with TP53 mutation IDH1/2 mutation was significantly shorter than that of patients with 1p/19q loss  IDH1/2 mutation (51.8 months vs. 58.7 months, respectively; P= 0.0037). Multivariate analysis with adjustment for age and treatment confirmed these results (P=0.0087) and also revealed that TP53 mutation is a significant prognostic marker for shorter survival (P=0.0005) and 1p/19q loss for longer survival (P=0.0002), while IDH1/2 mutations are not prognostic (P=0.8737).

    "abstract": "Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high-grade glioma, is characterized by being diffuse, invasive, and highly angiogenic, and has a very poor prognosis. Identification of new biomarkers could help in the further diagnosis of GBM.  Objective: To identify ELTD1 ([epidermal growth factor (EGF), latrophilin and seven transmembrane domain-containing 1] on chromosome 1) as a putative glioma-associated marker via a bioinformatic method.  Methods: We used advanced data mining and a novel bioinformatics method to predict ELTD1 as a potential novel biomarker that is associated with gliomas. Validation was done with immunohistochemistry (IHC), which was used to detect levels of ELTD1 in human high-grade gliomas, and rat F98 glioma tumors. In vivo levels of ELTD1 in rat F98 gliomas were assessed  using molecular MRI (mMRI).  Results: ELTD1 was found to be significantly higher (P=.03) in high-grade gliomas (50 patients) compared to low-grade gliomas (21 patients), and compared well to traditional IHC markers including VEGF, GLUT-1,CAIX, and HIF-1α. ELTD1 gene expression indicates an association with grade, survival across grade, and an increase in the mesenchymal subtype. Significantly high (P<0.001) in vivo levels of ELTD1 were additionally found in F98 tumors, compared to normal brain tissue.  Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that associative analysis was able to accurately identify ELTD1 as a putative glioma-associated biomarker. The detection of ELTD1 was also validated in both rodent and human gliomas, and may serve as an additional biomarker for gliomas in pre-clinical and clinical diagnosis of gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumor. Due to its highly promigratory and proinvasive properties, standard therapy including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation fails in eradicating this highly aggressive type of cancer. Here, we evaluated the role of TFPI-2, a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, which has been previously described as a tumor suppressor gene in several types of cancer, including glioma. TFPI-2 expression was absent in five of nine investigated high-grade glioma cell lines. Lentiviral knockdown of TFPI-2 in two of the TFPI-2-expressing cell lines (MZ-18 and Hs 638) was associated with pronounced changes in the cellular behavior: glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly increased in TFPI-2 knockdown cells in comparison to empty vector-transfected control cells. Since TFPI-2 might exert its tumor suppressor function by inhibiting MMPs, we subsequently analyzed the effects of specific MMP inhibitors on cell invasion of TFPI-2 KD cells vs. control cells. The data obtained from these experiments suggest that the anti-invasive properties of TFPI-2 are associated with inhibition of MMP-1 and MMP-2, while inhibition of MMP-9 seems to play a minor role in this context. Our findings underscore the important role of TFPI-2 as a tumor suppressor gene and indicate that TFPI-2 may be a useful diagnostic marker for the aggressive phenotype of glial tumors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Leucine-rich repeat C4 protein (LRRC4) is a new member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily. It is not only a brain-specific gene but also a novel candidate for tumor suppression. LRRC4 inactivation is commonly found in glioma cell lines and primary glioma biopsies. However, little is known about the mechanism controlling LRRC4 expression. In a previous study, we did not find any genetic alteration in LRRC4 in primary glioma, which led us to explore an alternative mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Methods: In the present paper, we cloned the LRRC4 promoter with characteristics of a CpG island by luciferase reporter assay. Then, the CpG methylation status around the LRRC4 promoter region in glioma cell lines and primary gliomas was examined by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite DNA sequencing. In order to demonstrate a functional association between LRRC4 promoter methylation and its gene inactivation, we performed DNA demethylation analysis with two human glioma cell lines using methylation-specific PCR and RT-PCR. Results: The sequence spanning positions -835 to -293 relative to the translation start site was identified as the LRRC4 promoter; this sequence is a TATA- and CAAT- less, high GC content region. It was found that LRRC4 promoter activity is strongly suppressed after treatment with SssI methylase in vitro. Furthermore, LRRC4 promoter methylation was observed by methylationspecific PCR in two glioma cell lines and all 30 primary glioma specimens, but not in normal brain tissue. Bisulfite DNA sequencing showed that most of the CpG sites were located around the LRRC4 promoter methylated in glioma cells and tissues, but not in normal brain tissue. In addition, the methylase inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine could induce LRRC4 mRNA expression and LRRC4 promoter partial demethylation in SF126 and SF767 glioma cells. Conclusion: Methylation-mediated inactivation of LRRC4 is a frequent and glioma-specific event, and it may be a potential biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis, or serve as a therapeutic target.",

Using the cellular models of acquired resistance to  TMZ, we further confirmed the up-regulation of MSH6 in TMZ resistant cells. Moreover, a  TCGA dataset contains a large cohort of GBM clinical samples with or without TMZ treatment reinforced the increased expression of MSH6 and other MMR genes after long-term  TMZ chemotherapy, which may resulted in MMR dysfunction and acquired TMZ resistance.  Our results suggest that increased expression of MSH6, or other MMR, may be a new  mechanism contributing to the acquired resistance during TMZ therapy; and may serve as an  indicator to the resistance in GBM.

    "abstract": "Actinin-4 is an isoform of nonmuscular α-actinin and actin-bundling protein that plays an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis by enhancing cellular motility. Recent studies have revealed an association between several clinicopathological profiles and actinin-4 overexpression in human cancers. In this study, we investigated the immunohistochemical actinin-4 expression in 39 infiltrating gliomas. The specimens included three diffuse astrocytomas, three oligodendrogliomas, one oligoastrocytoma, two anaplastic astrocytomas, four anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, three anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, 17 glioblastomas, four gliosarcomas, and two glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component. All seven World Health Organization (WHO) grade II tumors were negative for actinin-4, whereas 20 of 22 tumors with strong actinin-4 expression were WHO grade IV. Actinin-4 expression was significantly associated with histological grade (P<0.0001) and proliferative activity measured by Ki-67 staining (P = 0.0045). Notably, actinin-4 expression was more pronounced in high-grade astrocytic tumors than oligodendroglial tumors (P<0.0001). Additionally, pseudopalisading cells in glioblastoma exhibited stronger actinin- 4 expression than the rest, likely reflecting enhanced cellular motility in pseudopalisades. This study is the first to demonstrate significant correlation between actinin-4 expression and tumor grade using clinical glioma samples. Although diagnostic utility of this marker awaits future exploration, actinin-4 may help distinguish between astrocytic and oligodendroglial lines of differentiation.",

The records of 60 patients (30 women, 30 men; mean age, 45.4 years)suspected of having gliomas who underwent an ADC image-guided stereotactic biopsy were retrospectively reviewed. The values of FA and ADC were measured, and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of those parameters were calculated based on the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A predictive diagnostic equation was also constructed and evaluated. Significant differences in minimum ADC values were found in the quantitative analysis between the grade III and II glioma groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracy and AUC for identifying grade III and II gliomas at the optimum cut-off value of 0.895×103 mm2 /s of minimum ADC were 81.0, 89.1, 77.3, 91.1, 86.6 and 0.87, respectively.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The extent of glioma resection influences the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Ferroptosis is a newly recognized type of cell death, which may be associated with low-grade glioma border detection and OS. This study is assessed an optimized ferroptosis gene panel for glioma treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We obtained 45 reports on ferroptosis-related proteins in PubMed and conducted a statistical test of the patients' overall survival (OS) in the TCGA GBMLGG and CGGA databases. The statistically significant genes were screened for an optimal panel, followed by GO and KEGG analysis and evaluated its correlation with known prognostic factors of glioma, including IDH1 mutation, methylated MGMT, tumor purity, 1p/19q LOH, and methionine cycle. RESULTS Eight genes panel (ALOX5, CISD1, FTL, CD44, FANCD2, NFE2L2, SLC1A5, and GOT1) were highly related to OS (P<0.001) and PFS (P<0.001) of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, out of which 6 genes (ALOX5, CISD1, CD44, FTL, FANCD2, and SLC1A5) were correlated with IDH1_p.R132H (P<0.001) and 5 genes (ALOX5, CD44, FTL, NFE2L2, SLC1A5) showed a correlation with tumor purity (P<0.001). Five genes (ALOX5, CD44, CISD1, FTL, and SLC1A5) were associated with methylated MGMT (P<0.001), out of which 6 genes (ALOX5, CD44, FANCD2, NFE2L2, SLC1A5, and GOT1) had significantly different expression in healthy brain tissue vs. glioma (P<0.001).

    "abstract": "Background: Glioma is one of the most common malignant brain tumors and exhibits low resection rate and high recurrence risk. Although a large number of glioma studies powered by high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to massive multi-omics datasets, there lacks of comprehensive integration of glioma datasets for uncovering candidate biomarker genes.\n\nResults: In this study, we collected a large-scale assemble of multi-omics multi-cohort datasets from worldwide public resources, involving a total of 16,939 samples across 19 independent studies. Through comprehensive molecular profiling across different datasets, we revealed that PRKCG (Protein Kinase C Gamma), a brain-specific gene detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, is closely associated with glioma. Specifically, it presents lower expression and higher methylation in glioma samples compared with normal samples. PRKCG expression/methylation change from high to low is indicative of glioma progression from low-grade to high-grade and high RNA expression is suggestive of good survival. Importantly, PRKCG in combination with MGMT is effective to predict survival outcomes in a more precise manner.\n\nConclusions: PRKCG bears the great potential for glioma diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, and PRKCG-like genes may represent a set of important genes associated with different molecular mechanisms in glioma tumorigenesis. Our study indicates the importance of computational integrative multi-omics data analysis and represents a datadriven scheme toward precision tumor subtyping and accurate personalized healthcare.",

Materials and methods: 27 cases were collected from six hospitals, followed by a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological, and morphological data. MYB protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining (IHC), and the MYB-QKI rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Among the 27 cases (16 males), the median age at surgery was 17 years (range 3 - 43 years); 24 (88.9%) cases had a history of refractory epilepsy, and the mean history of pre-surgical epilepsy was 13 years (range 1.5 - 27 years); 26 (96.3%) cases had lesions located in the superficial cerebrocortical regions, and 1 (3.7%) case had a lesion in the brainstem. Except for the classic histological features, the involvement of superficial cortex extending to the leptomeninges, microcalcification, and cystic pattern with microcystic formations was observed in 11 (40.7%), 3 (11.1%), and 4 (14.8%) cases, respectively. IHC showed that all 27 cases were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, and negative for neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN). The positive rates of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and D2-40 were 81.5% (22/27) and 74.1% (20/27), respectively. A total of 14 (51.9%) cases were positive for MYB. The rate of Ki-67 proliferation was 1 - 5% in 25 cases, and in 2 cases with anaplastic features it was 10 and 20%. MYB-QKI rearrangement was revealed by FISH examination in 95.8% (23/24) of the AGs, including 3 cases with atypical histological appearance. Conclusion: Compared to IHC, FISH was more appropriate for detecting MYB-QKI rearrangement. MYB-QKI rearrangement was detected in the majority of Chinese AG cases, and therefore represents a potential diagnostic biomarker for AG.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mir-9 was recognized as a potential tumor suppressor gene or oncogene in varies of diseases; however, its roles in glioma have not been investigated. Our study was to identify the mRNA expression of mir-9 gene in glioma and correlate abnormal versions of microRNAs with clinicopathological features and investigate the impact of mir-9 in glioma prognosis.\n\nMethods: Seventy-one glioma samples, which included 22 grade II, 24 grade III, and 25 glioblastoma tumors of previously untreated patients who underwent surgical excision at Qing Hai Province People's Hospital from 2011 to 2014, were included. In addition, 2 epilepsy patients with normal brain tissue were included as a control group. The expression of mir-9 was examined by RT-PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded primary tissue specimens. The clinicopathologic features, the survival rate of glioma patients were also discussed. The RNA expression of mir-9 and glioma prognosis was evaluated using a Chi-square test, Cox regression model, and GraphPad Prism survival curve analysis.\n\nResults: There were 16, 20, 21 cases which showed high expression of mir-9 in grade II and III gliomas and glioblastoma, 16/22 (72.7%), 20/24 (83.3%), 21/25 (84.0%), respectively. The expression of mir-9 was correlated with the grade of glioma. The mir-9 RNA expression in glioblastoma were higher than grade II and III gliomas (p < 0.05). The higher the grade, the higher the expression, and the difference was significant (p < 0.05), while it was not correlated with patient nationality, gender, or location (p > 0.05). Univariate analysis determined that high expression of mir-9, grade, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and patient onset age were associated with glioma patient prognosis (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusions: The expression of mir-9 plays a role in glioma progression, and may be used as a prognostic marker in glioma.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is one of the primary tumors of the central nervous system that occurs in the spinal cord or brain and the origin of the tumor is from glial cell cells. The most common site of glioma tumors is the brain. Glioma accounts for 30% of all central nervous system tumors and 80% of malignant brain tumors. Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) mutations are frequently distinguished in gliomas. Current research is an attempt to assess ATRX immunoexpression in different types of gliomas diagnosed, in Erbil-Iraq, and to evaluate its association with patient's age, gender, tumor location, grade and type. From January 2015 to January 2017, we reviewed and analyzed 97 cases of glioma. Immunohistochemical staining, for ATRX, was performed using an automated immunostainer technique. According to the WHO grading system for brain tumors, 16 (16.5%) cases were grade I gliomas, 27 (27.8%) were grade II, 10 (10.3%) were anaplastic gliomas (grade III), and 44 (45.3%) cases were glioblastomas WHO (grade IV). Positive ATRX immunoexpression was demonstrated in 27 (27.8%) cases. The highest rates of ATRX expression (55.6%) were among 30-39 years' age group, supratentorial (34.2%), and among grade II and III tumors (40.7% and 30% respectively). A significant association was observed between ATRX expression and patient's age, tumor location, tumor type and grade (p-values 0.010, 0.004, 0.004, and 0.037 respectively). No significant association was found between ATRX expression and patient's gender (p-value 0.097). It was found that ATRX is frequently expressed in grade II and III astrocytomas and was significantly related to the patient's age, tumor location, type and grade, so it can be used as a good diagnostic and prognostic indicator for glioma.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is diagnosed as the most common intracranial malignant tumor. cancer stem cells determine stemness and radioresistance, and may facilitate glioma recurrence. The present study aimed to investigate whether the long non - coding RNA (lncrna) transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology pseudogene 1 (TPTeP1) regulated cell stemness and radioresistance of glioma, and determine the underlying molecular mechanism of TPT eP1 in the modulation of glioma progression. C ell and molecular biology techniques were applied for investigating the role of TPTeP1 in glioma cell lines, animal model, and clinical samples. The results demonstrated that TPT eP1 attenuated stemness and radioresistance of glioma both in vitro and in vivo. in addition, TPT eP1 augmented M A PK14 expression by competitively interacting with microrna (mi r) -106a-5p, thus activating the P38 M A PK signaling pathway, and suppressing glioma stemness and radioresistance. TPTeP1 functionally bound to mi r-106a-5p, which formed a reciprocal regulatory loop to stimulate the P38 M A PK signaling pathway. L ow TPT eP1 expression levels were detected in high-grade glioma tissues compared with low-grade glioma tissues, and were positively associated with poor prognosis of patients with glioma. Furthermore, analysis using data from The cancer Genome atlas database confirmed the molecular mechanism and biological significance of dysregulation of TPTEP1 in glioma progression. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that TPTEP1 may be applied as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator for glioma, and may be an alternative target for the treatment of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Accumulating evidence implies that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in predicting survival for glioma patients. However, the potential function of lncRNA ELF3-antisense RNA 1 (ELF3-AS1) in tumors remained largely unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the expression of lncRNA ELF3-antisense RNA 1 (ELF3-AS1) and evaluate its functions in glioma patients. Patients and Methods. ELF3-AS1 expressions were examined by RT-PCR in 182 pairs of glioma specimens and adjacent normal tissues. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to estimate the diagnostic value of ELF3-AS1. The chi-square tests were used to examine the associations between ELF3-AS1 expression and the clinicopathological characters. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed by log-rank test, and survival curves were plotted according to Kaplan-Meier. The prognostic value of the ELF3-AS1 expression in glioma patients was further analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss-of-function assays were performed to determine the potential function of ELF3-AS1 on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Results. The ELF3-AS1 expression level was signiﬁcantly higher in glioma specimens compared with adjacent nontumor specimens (p < 0:01). A high expression of ELF3-AS1 was shown to be associated with the WHO grade (p = 0:023) and KPS score (p = 0:012). ROC assays revealed that high ELF3-AS1 expression had an AUC value of 0.8073 (95% CI: 0.7610 to 0.8535) for glioma. Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that patients with a high ELF3-AS1 expression had signiﬁcantly poor OS (p = 0:006) and DFS (p = 0:0002). In a multivariate Cox model, we conﬁrmed that ELF3-AS1 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that knockdown of ELF3-AS1 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Conclusions. Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed that ELF3-AS1 functions as an oncogene in glioma and indicated that ELF3-AS1 is not only an important prognostic marker but also a potential therapy target for glioma.",

    "abstract": "Background: Glioma is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, and angiogenesis is one of the key factors contributing to its proliferation, aggressiveness, and malignant transformation. However, the discovery of novel oncogenes and the study of its molecular regulating mechanism based on circular RNAs (circRNAs) may provide a promising treatment target in glioma.\n\nMethods: Bioinformatics analysis, qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression levels of ISL2, miR-342-3p, circRNA ARF1 (cARF1), U2AF2, and VEGFA. Patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) were established for the molecular experiments. Lentiviral-based infection was used to regulate the expression of these molecules in GSCs. The MTS, EDU, Transwell, and tube formation assays were used to detect the proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of human brain microvessel endothelial cells (hBMECs). RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, dual-luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect the direct regulation mechanisms among these molecules.\n\nResults: We first identified a novel transcription factor related to neural development. ISL2 was overexpressed in glioma and correlated with poor patient survival. ISL2 transcriptionally regulated VEGFA expression in GSCs and promoted the proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of hBMECs via VEGFA-mediated ERK signaling. Regarding its mechanism of action, cARF1 upregulated ISL2 expression in GSCs via miR-342-3p sponging. Furthermore, U2AF2 bound to and promoted the stability and expression of cARF1, while ISL2 induced the expression of U2AF2, which formed a feedback loop in GSCs. We also showed that both U2AF2 and cARF1 had an oncogenic effect, were overexpressed in glioma, and correlated with poor patient survival.\n\nConclusions: Our study identified a novel feedback loop among U2AF2, cARF1, miR-342-3p, and ISL2 in GSCs. This feedback loop promoted glioma angiogenesis, and could provide an effective biomarker for glioma diagnosis and prognostic evaluation, as well as possibly being used for targeted therapy.",

A luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the target of miR-9-3p. Moreover, cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry assays were used to assess proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The present study demonstrated that miR-9-3p is significantly downregulated, and FOXG1 is significantly upregulated, in patients with glioma. miR-9-3p overexpression inhibited proliferation and increased the apoptosis of both U87MG and TG-905 cells. In addition, FOXG1 was identified as a direct target of miR-9 -3p, and FOXG1 silencing enhanced the inhibitory effect of miR-9-3p on proliferation and apoptosis in U87 MG and TG-905 cells.

All patients underwent repeat surgery or biopsy after routine MRI and DKI (including DTI). They were histologically classified into high-grade glioma recurrence and PsP groups. DKI (mean kurtosis [MK], axial kurtosis [Ka], and radial kurtosis [Kr]) and DTI (mean diffusivity [MD] and fractional anisotropy [FA]) parameters in the enhancing lesions and in the perilesional edema were measured. Inter-group differences between high-grade glioma recurrence and PsP were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess differential diagnostic efficacy of each parameter, and Z-scores were used to compare the value between DKI and DTI.\n\nResults: Relative MK (rMK) was significantly higher and relative MD (rMD) was significantly lower in the enhancing lesions of high-grade glioma recurrence compared to PsP (P < 0.001, P = 0.006, respectively).

Although LRG1 has been associated with angiogenesis, it has been suggested that its biomarker role differs depending on the type of tumor. In this study, a clinicopathological examination of LRG1's role as a biomarker for glioblastoma was performed. We used tumor tissues of 155 cases with diffuse gliomas (27 astrocytomas, 14 oligodendrogliomas, 114 glioblastomas). The immunohistochemical LRG1 intensity scoring was classified into 2 groups: low expression and high expression. Mutations of IDH1, IDH2, and TERT promoter were analyzed through the Sanger method. We examined the relationship between LRG1 expression level in glioblastoma and clinical parameters, such as age, preoperative Karnofsky performance status, tumor location, extent of resection, O 6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter, and prognosis. LRG1 high expression rate was 41.2% in glioblastoma, 3.7% in astrocytoma, and 21.4% in oligodendroglioma. Glioblastoma showed a significantly higher LRG1 expression than lowergrade glioma (p = 0.0003). High expression of LRG1 was an independent favorable prognostic factor (p = 0.019) in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and correlated with gross total resection (p = 0.002) and the tumor location on nonsubventricular zone (p = 0.00007).

To research the specific mechanism by which miR-186 regulates apoptosis within gliomas.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: RT-qPCR was performed to verify the transcriptional level of miR-186 within glioma tissues and glioma cells. miRanda and Dual-Luciferase assay were performed to predict and confirm that Smad6 gene is an effective target of miR-186 within glioma. The expression of Smad6 protein was tested by Western blot following cell effective transfection. Apoptosis of gliomas was analyzed by inverted fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.\n\nRESULTS: The mRNA level of miR-186 was suppressed within glioma tissues and glioma U87 cells. MiR-186 is associated with apoptosis in glioma. Overexpression of miR-186 promoted U87 cell apoptosis, whereas suppression of miR-186 had the opposite effect. Besides, miR-186 directly targeted Smad6 and suppress its expression in glioma. The expression of Smad6 affected the regulation of miR-186 on glioma cell apoptosis, restoration of Smad6 rescued apoptosis of glioma U87 cells induced by miR-186 mimics, whereas inhibition of Smad6 promoted apoptosis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: As noted above, miR-186 exerts a tumor-suppressing effect by targeting Smad6.

As biomedicine advances, an efficient molecular target is urgently needed for the diagnosis and treatment of glioma. Meanwhile, several studies have demonstrated that glioma development is closely related to immunity. PARP9 is an inactive monoADP-ribosyltransferase belonging to the poly-ADP ribosyltransferase (ARTD) family. In this article, we aimed to reveal the relationship between PARP9 and glioma and explore the potential prognostic value and immunotherapeutic targetability of PARP9 in glioma.\n\nMethods: PARP9 transcript levels were analyzed with TCGA and GEO databases. The clinicopathological information of patients with glioma in the TCGA database and gene expression profiles were analyzed to determine the relationship between the expression of PARP9 and clinicopathologic characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate Cox regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used for survival analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used for bioinformatics analysis. Correlation analysis explored the relationships between PARP9, infiltrating inflammatory immune cells, and immune checkpoint molecules.\n\nResults: PARP9 is highly expressed in glioma, and high expression of PARP9 is associated with poor prognosis and advanced clinicopathological features. Bioinformatics analysis showed that some immune-related pathways were closely associated with high expression of PARP9. Correlation analysis indicated that PARP9 was closely related to inflammatory and immune responses, high immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint molecules.\n\nConclusions: PARP9 may serve as an unfavorable prognosis predictor for glioma and a potential immunotherapeutic target.",

However, the role of PTTG1 in glioblastoma (GBM) has not been well characterized, especially in relation to angiogenesis, migration, and invasion. In the present study, our results showed that the expression of PTTG1 was significantly higher in patients with GBM. Bioinformatic analysis showed that angiogenesis and the cell migration-related process were increased in patients with high PTTG1 expression levels; meanwhile, PTTG1 was positively correlated with marker genes of angiogenesis, migration and the evasion of apoptosis. In vitro assays showed that PTTG1 knockdown dramatically suppressed angiogenesis, migration and invasion, and increased the apoptosis of GBM cells. Moreover, our results also showed that silencing PTTG1 suppressed the activity of the TGF-β/PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which induced tumor deterioration in multiple organs. Overall, our findings indicate that PTTG1 is a glioma malignant factor that promotes angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and the evasion of apoptosis, and these roles may be related to the TGF-β/PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Thus, the targeted inhibition of PTTG1 might be a novel therapeutic strategy and a potential diagnostic biomarker for GBM-targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the well-characterized expression profile of miR-351 in the neural system, its molecular mechanisms in glioma still remain elusive. Here we intended to assess the regulatory function of miR-351 on nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (NAIF1) and, thereby, modulation of cancerous behaviors of human glioma cell lines. Two human glioma cell lines (U87 and U251) and normal human astroglia (NHA) cell line were cultured. The cell lines were prepared and transfected with mimic, inhibitor, and negative controls (NCs) of miR-351, then MTT and wound healing assays were performed. We extracted the total protein for western blotting assay and isolated the total RNA for real-time PCR. The miR-351 expression was significantly decreased in U87 and U251 cell lines compared with the NHA cell line (P < 0.05). NAIF1 expression was significantly higher in glioma cell lines compared with the NHA cell line (P < 0.05). Moreover, the NAIF1 expression showed a negative correlation with miR-351 (P = 0.005, r = −0.522). Apoptosis was significantly decreased in both cell lines transfected with miR-351 mimics compared with the NC group at 72 and 96 h after transfection (P < 0.05) and significantly increased in the transfected group with miR-351 inhibitors compared with the NC group at 72 and 96 h after transfection (P < 0.05). According to our results, after 24 and 48 h, migration was increased in the mimic group compared with the miR-351 NC group and decreased in the inhibitory group compared with the miR-351 NC group in the U251 cell line.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults that originates from glial cells. The prognosis of patients with high-grade glioma is poor. It is therefore crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as potential inducers or suppressors of tumor progression. Previous studies have indicated that the lncRNA Feline Leukemia Virus Subgroup C Cellular Receptor 1 Antisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1-AS1) is involved in the development and progression of gastric and lung cancer, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma; however, the biological effect of FLVCR1-AS1 in glioma is not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how FLVCR1-AS1 modulates cell proliferation and invasion in glioma. FLVCR1-AS1 expression was significantly upregulated in GBM tissues compared with adjacent normal brain samples, and was higher in GBM cell lines compared with normal human astrocyte cells. Furthermore, the microRNA (miR)-30b-3p was revealed to be a putative target of FLVCR1-AS1, and the suppressive effects of miR-30b-3p on cellular proliferation and invasion were reversed following FLVCR1-AS1-knockdown. The results from Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assays confirmed that FLVCR1-AS1-knockdown inhibited GBM cell proliferation and invasion ability. In addition, FLVCR1-AS1 was found to directly interact with miR-30b-3p, and a rescue experiment further established that FLVCR1-AS1 contributed to glioma progression by inhibiting miR-30b-3p. The results from the present study demonstrated that FLVCR1-AS1 may serve an oncogenic role in GBM and promote disease progression by interacting with miR-30b-3p. These findings suggested that FLVCR1-AS1 may be considered as a novel therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker for GBM",

In the present study, we aimed to screen microRNA (miRNA) markers in serum exosomes for diﬀerential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma using high-throughput sequencing technology. Methods. Patients with intracranial lymphoma or high-grade glioma and healthy controls were included in this study (training cohort (n = 10) and validation cohort: intracranial lymphoma (n = 10), high-grade glioma (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 20)). After RNA was extracted from serum exosomes, the high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the expression proﬁles of serum exosomal miRNAs and screen the diﬀerentially expressed miRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expressions of the selected miRNAs. The diﬀerences of miRNA expressions between groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The diagnostic value was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that 170 miRNAs, including 109 upregulated ones and 61 downregulated ones, were diﬀerentially expressed in serum exosomes between the patients with intracranial lymphoma and high-grade glioma. Compared with the healthy controls, the number of diﬀerential serum exosomal miRNAs in the high-grade glioma group and intracranial lymphoma group was 130 and 173, respectively. RT-qPCR proved that both miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p were signiﬁcantly downregulated in high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma patients compared with the healthy controls (all p < 0:001), and the expression of serum exosomal miR-766-5p in the intracranial lymphoma group was lower compared with the high-grade glioma group (p < 0:05). The areas under ROC curve (AUCs) of serum exosomal miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p for the diagnosis of glioma were 0.8883 (p < 0:001) and 0.7688 (p = 0:001), respectively, and they were 0.9271 (p < 0:001) and 0.8542 (p < 0:001), respectively, for the diagnosis of intracranial lymphoma. Moreover, the AUC value of serum exosomal miR-766-5p for the diﬀerential diagnosis of glioma and intracranial lymphoma was 0.7201 (p = 0:026). Conclusions. miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p in serum exosomes might be used as auxiliary diagnostic indicators for high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma, and miR-766-5p might be used as a diﬀerential diagnostic marker for both diseases.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that have shown to regulate the progression of human diseases, including a variety of cancers. We aimed to investigate the function and the underlying working mechanism of circRNA matrix metallopeptidase 1 (circMMP1; hsa_circ_0024108) in glioma progression. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the expression of circMMP1, microRNA-433-3p (written as \"miR-433\") and high mobility group box 3 (HMGB3). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was used to analyze the relative concentration and size distribution of serum exosomes. Cell proliferation was analyzed via cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and colony formation assay. Transwell migration and invasion assays were used to examine the metastasis ability of glioma cells. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to verify the interactions of circMMP1/miR-433 and miR-433/HMGB3 messenger RNA (mRNA). Xenograft mouse model was built to clarify the role of circMMP1 in vivo. The results showed that high serum exosomal circMMP1 level might predict poor prognosis of glioma patients. CircMMP1 promoted the proliferation and motility and impeded the apoptosis of glioma cells. MiR-433 was a direct target of circMMP1, and circMMP1 silencing-mediated influences in glioma cells were partly alleviated by the knockdown of miR-433. MiR-433 directly interacted with HMGB3 mRNA, and HMGB3 overexpression partly counteracted the effects of miR-433 up-regulation in glioma cells. CircMMP1 enhanced HMGB3 level through sponging miR-433 in glioma cells. CircMMP1 silencing suppressed the progression of glioma in vivo. CircMMP1 promoted the progression of glioma through acting as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-433 to up-regulate HMGB3. CircMMP1 level in serum exosomes might be a potential marker for the diagnosis of glioma patients. Targeting circMMP1/miR-433/ HMGB3 signaling might be a novel insight for glioma treatment.",

The present study aimed at exploring the diagnostic and prognostic value of lncRNA Zinc finger protein 667-antisense RNA 1 (ZNF667-AS1) in glioma patients. Patients and Methods. The expressions of ZNF667-AS1 were detected in 155 glioma tissues and matched normal brain tissue samples by qRT-PCR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to estimate the diagnostic value of ZNF667-AS1. The association between the ZNF667-AS1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed by the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to determine the influence of the ZNF667-AS1 expression on the overall survival and disease-free survival of glioma patients. The Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of independent prognostic factors on survival outcome. Cell proliferation was measured by the respective cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays.\n\nResults: We observed that ZNF667-AS1 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared to normal tissue samples (p < 0.01). Higher levels of ZNF667-AS1 were positively associated with the WHO grade (p = 0.018) and KPS score (p = 0.008).

Moreover, multivariate analyses confirmed that the ZNF667-AS1 expression was an independent predictor of the overall survival and disease-free survival for glioma patients.

    "abstract": "Background: The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign is an imaging finding highly suggestive of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutated (IDH-mut) 1p19q non-codeleted (non-codel) gliomas (astrocytomas). In previous studies, it has shown excellent specificity but limited sensitivity for IDH-mut astrocytomas. Whether the mismatch sign is a marker of a clinically relevant subtype of IDH-mut astrocytomas is unknown.\n\nMethods: We included histopathologically verified supratentorial lower-grade gliomas (LGG) WHO grade II-III retrospectively during the period 2010-2016. In the period 2017-2018, patients with suspected LGG radiologically were prospectively included, and in this cohort other diagnoses than glioma could occur. Clinical, radiological and molecular data were collected. For clinical evaluation we included all patients with IDH-mut astrocytomas. In the 2010-2016 cohort DNA methylation analysis with Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) was performed for patients with an IDH-mut astrocytoma with available tissue. We aimed to examine the association of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign with clinical factors and outcomes. Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic reliability of the mismatch sign and its relation to methylation profiles.\n\nResults: Out of 215 patients with LGG, 135 had known IDH-mutation and 1p19q codeletion status. Fifty patients had an IDH-mut astrocytoma and 12 of these (24.0%) showed a mismatch sign. The sensitivity and specificity of the mismatch sign for IDH-mut detection were 26.4 and 97.6%, respectively. There were no differences between patients with an IDH-mut astrocytoma with or without mismatch sign when grouped according to T2-FLAIR mismatch sign with respect to baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes and methylation profiles. The overall interrater agreement between neuroradiologist and clinical neurosurgeons for the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign was significant when all 215 MRI examination assessed (κ = 0.77, p < 0.001, N = 215).\n\nConclusion: The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign in patients with an IDH-mut astrocytoma is not associated with clinical presentation or outcome. It seems unlikely that the IDH-mut astrocytomas with mismatch sign represent a specific subentity. Finally, we have validated that the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign is a reliable and specific marker of IDH-mut astrocytomas.",

However, the molecular mechanisms through which PDI contributes to glioma remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the differential expression of 17 PDI family members was closely related to the different clinicopathological features in gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas data sets. Additionally, four subgroups of gliomas (cluster 1/2/3/4) were identified based on consensus clustering of the PDI gene family. These findings not only demonstrated that a poorer prognosis, higher WHO grade, lower frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and higher 1p/19q non-codeletion status were significantly correlated with cluster 4 compared with the other clusters, but also indicated that the malignant progression of glioma was closely correlated with the expression of PDI family members. Moreover, we also constructed an independent prognostic marker that can predict the clinicopathological features of gliomas. Overall, the results indicated that PDI family members may serve as possible diagnostic markers in gliomas.",

Here, we firstly reported the dysregulation of Rhoj in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of Rhoj in GBM. We analyzed the expression of 21 Rho GTPases family members and validated the expression of Rhoj in GBM by immunohistochemistry. We further investigated the role and mechanism of Rhoj in GBM both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that Rhoj is significantly overexpressed in GBM and associated with patients' survival. However, the role and underlying molecular mechanism of Rhoj in GBM are still unclear. We demonstrated that transcription factor c-Jun regulated the expression of Rhoj, and Rhoj interacted with moesin to promote GBM cell proliferation and migration by potentiating the activation of Rac1/PAK pathway and cytoskeletal dynamics. Rhoj may promote migration and invasion of GBM cells by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process. In conclusion, the Rhoj/Rac1/PAK signaling mediates invasion and progression of GBM and is a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and angiogenesis play important roles in glioma growth, invasion, and recurrence. The present study aimed to use proteomic methods to probe into the role of the EGF-EGFR-angiogenesis axis in the tumorigenesis of glioma and access the therapeutic efficacy of selumetinib on glioma.\n\nMethods: Proteomic profiling was used to characterize 200 paired EGFRpositive and EGFR-negative glioma tissues of all pathological types. The quantitative mass spectrometry data were used for systematic analysis of the proteomic profiles of 10 EGFR-positive and 10 EGFR-negative glioma cases. Consensusclustering analysis was used to screen target proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis, cell growth assay, and intracranial xenograft experiments were used to verify and test the therapeutic effect of selumetinib on glioma.\n\nResults: Advanced proteomic screening demonstrated that the expression of EGF-like domain multiple 7 (EGFL7) was higher in EGFR-positive tumor tissues than in EGFR-negative tumor tissues. In addition, EGFL7 could act as an activator in vitro and in vivo to promote glioma cell proliferation. EGFL7 was associated strongly with EGFR and prognosis. EGFL7 knockdown effectively suppressed glioma cell proliferation.

    "abstract": "Background. High-grade glioma is the most pervasive and lethal of all brain malignancies. Despite advances in imaging technologies, discriminating between gliomas and other brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) often requires brain biopsy. Several reports show that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Z (PTPRZ) is highly expressed in glioblastoma, and we found that a soluble cleaved form of PTPRZ (sPTPRZ) was present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The aim of this study was to determine whether the sPTPRZ level in CSF has utility as a diagnostic marker for glioma.\n\nMethods. Microarray datasets from normal brain tissue and brain tumors were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. PTPRZ protein expression in clinical specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Semiquantitative western blotting was used to measure sPTPRZ levels in CSF samples from patients with glioma, schwannoma, MS, or nontumor disorders.\n\nResults. Expression of PTPRZ mRNA and protein was markedly increased in glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and schwannoma tissues compared with control brain tissue. sPTPRZ was present at significantly elevated levels in the CSF of patients with glioma (grades 1-4), but not in patients with schwannoma or MS, compared with the control samples. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sPTPRZ in CSF could discriminate between glioma and MS patients (area under the curve 0.9676; P < .0001).\n\nConclusions. sPTPRZ in CSF is a promising diagnostic biomarker for glioma and could reduce the need for a surgical biopsy.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify GBM cell-selective secreted proteins by analyzing conditioned media (CM) from GBM, breast, and colon cancer cell lines using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectramass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) and targeted proteomics. We identiﬁed 2371 proteins in the CM from GBM and the other cancer cell lines. Among the proteins identiﬁed, 15 showed signiﬁcantly higher expression in the CM from GBM cell lines than in those from other cancer cell lines. These GBM-selective secreted proteins were further quantiﬁed in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) from patients with GBM. Laminin subunit alpha-4 (LAMA4) and osteopontin (OPN) had increased expression levels in the CSF from GBM patients compared to those from non-brain tumor patients. In addition, the areas under the curves in a receiver operating characteristic analysis of LAMA4 and OPN were greater than 0.9, allowing for discrimination of GBM patients from non-brain tumor patients. The CSF levels of LAMA4 and OPN were also signiﬁcantly correlated with the GBM tumor volume.

Most tumors including low-grade oligodendrogliomas use telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression for telomere maintenance while astrocytomas use the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Although TERT and ALT are hallmarks of tumor proliferation and attractive therapeutic targets, translational methods of imaging TERT and ALT are lacking. Here we show that TERT and ALT are associated with unique 1 H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable metabolic signatures in genetically-engineered and patient-derived glioma models and patient biopsies. Importantly, we have leveraged this information to mechanistically validate hyperpolarized [1- 13 C]-alanine ﬂux to pyruvate as an imaging biomarker of ALT status and hyperpolarized [1- 13 C]-alanine ﬂux to lactate as an imaging biomarker of TERT status in low-grade gliomas.

The results were correlated with patients' clinicopathological features.\n\nResults: DNA methylation level of all analyzed genes was significantly higher in brain tumor samples as compared to non-neoplastic brain and commercial, unmethylated DNA control. RASSF1A was the most frequently methylated gene, with statistically significant differences depending on the tumor WHO grade. Higher MGMT methylation levels were observed in females, whereas the levels of SFRP1 and INA promoter methylation significantly increased with patients' age. A positive correlation of promoter methylation levels was observed between pairs of genes, for example, CBLN4 and INA or MGMT and RASSF1A.\n\nConclusions: Our 7-gene panel of promoter methylation can be helpful in brain tumor diagnosis or characterization, and MS-HRM is a suitable method for its analysis.",

We aimed to reveal the relationship between HOXA2 and glioma based on the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas(CGGA) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). HOXA2 expression data and clinically relevant information of glioma patients were obtained from the CGGA and TCGA containing 1447 glioma tissues and five non-tumor brain tissues. The Wilcox or Kruskal tests were used to detect the correlation between the HOXA2 expression level and clinical data of glioma patients. the Kaplan-Meier method were used to examine the relationship between HOXA2 and overall patient survival. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to indirectly reveal the signaling pathways involved in HOXA2, and RT-PCR was used to detect HOXA2 expression in gliomas and non-tumor brain tissues. High HOXA2 expression was found to be positively correlated with clinical grade, histological type, age, and tumor recurrence, but negatively correlated with 1p19 codeletion and isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status.RT-PCR results showed that HOXA2 expression levels were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in non-tumor brain tissues. GSEA showed that HOXA2 promoted the activation of the activation of the JAK-STAT-signaling pathway, focal adhesion, cell-adhesion-molecules-CAMS pathway, cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This study revealed for the first time that the novel oncogene,HOXA2, leads to poor prognosis in gliomas, and can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of gliomas.",

The mean values of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV), normalized cerebral blood flow, volume transfer constant, rate transfer coefficient, extravascular extracellular volume fraction, plasma volume fraction, and APT asymmetry index were assessed. Independent quantitative parameters were investigated to predict recurrent glioma using multivariable logistic regression. The incremental value of APT signal to other parameters was assessed by the increase of the area under the curve, net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement.\n\nResults Univariable analysis showed that lower ADC (p = 0.018), higher FA (p = 0.031), higher nCBV (p = 0.021), and higher APT signal (p = 0.009) were associated with recurrent gliomas. In multivariable logistic regression, the diagnostic performance of the model with ADC, FA, and nCBV significantly increased when APT signal was added, with areas under the curve of 0.87 and 0.92, respectively (net reclassification index of 0.77 and integrated discrimination improvement of 0.13).\n\nConclusion APT imaging may be a useful imaging biomarker that adds value to DTI, DCE, and DSC parameters for distinguishing between recurrent gliomas and treatment-induced changes.",

There was a substantial agreement between the two raters for the detection of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign (Cohen's kappa coeﬃcient was 0.647).

However, the significance of soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) remains unclear in the patients with brain glioma. Here we aimed to investigate the significance of serum sCTLA-4 levels as a noninvasive biomarker for diagnosis and evaluation of the prognosis in glioma patients.\n\nMethods: In this study, the levels of sCTLA-4 in serum from 50 patients diagnosed with different grade gliomas including preoperative and postoperative, and 50 healthy individuals were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). And then ROC curve analysis and survival analyses were performed to explore the clinical significance of sCTLA-4.\n\nResults: Serum sCTLA-4 levels were significantly increased in patients with glioma compared to that of healthy individuals, and which was also positively correlated with the tumor grade. ROC curve analysis showed that the best cutoff value for sCTLA-4 for glioma is 112.1 pg/ml, as well as the sensitivity and specificity with 82.0 and 78.0%, respectively, and a cut-off value of 220.43 pg/ml was best distinguished in patients between low-grade glioma group and high-grade glioma group with sensitivity 73.1% and specificity 79.2%. Survival analysis revealed that the patients with high sCTLA-4 levels (> 189.64 pg/ml) had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those with low sCTLA-4 levels (≤189.64 pg/ml). In the univariate analysis, elder, high-grade tumor, high sCTLA-4 levels and high Ki-67 index were significantly associated with shorter PFS. In the multivariate analysis, sCTLA-4 levels and tumor grade remained an independent prognostic factor.\n\nConclusion: These findings indicated that serum sCTLA-4 levels play a critical role in the pathogenesis and development of glioma, which might become a valuable predictive biomarker for supplementary diagnosis and evaluation of the progress and prognosis in glioma.",

    "abstract": "Signiﬁcant advance has been made towards understanding glioblastoma metabolism through global metabolomic proﬁling. However, hitherto little is known about the role by which altered metabolism plays in driving the aggressive glioma phenotype. We have previously identiﬁed hypotaurine as one of the top-ranked metabolites for differentiating low- and high-grade tumors, and that there is also a strong association between the levels of intratumoral hypotaurine and expression of its biosynthetic enzyme, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO). Using transcription proﬁling, we further uncovered that the ADO/hypotaurine axis targets CCL20 secretion through activating the NF-κB pathway to drive the self-renewal and maintenance of glioma 'cancer stem cells' or glioma cancer stem-like cells. Conversely, abrogating the ADO/hypotaurine axis using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing limited glioblastoma cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopical mouse model, indicating that this metabolic pathway is a potential key therapeutic target. Collectively, our results unveil a targetable metabolic pathway, which contributes to the growth and progression of aggressive high-grade gliomas, as well as a novel predictive marker for glioblastoma diagnosis and therapy.",

The mean ADCt and ADCtch values and ratios were measured.\n\nResults: Of the 125 patients, 22 (17.6%) had a low-grade glioma (LGG), 55 (44%) had a high-grade glioma (HGG), 32 (25.6%) had metastasis, and 16 (12.8%) had lymphoma diagnosis. There was a statistically significant difference in LGG and HGG in terms of mean ADCt and mean ADCtch values, and ratios. ADCtch values and ratios showed a statistically significant difference in the differentiation of HGG and metastasis and in the differentiation of HGG and lymphoma. According to ROC curve analysis, a cut-off value of 1.49 × 10−3 mm2/s for the mean ADCtch value generated the best combination of 70% sensitivity and 71% specificity for differentiation of HGGs and metastasis. The mean ADCtch value had the highest statistical predictive value for differentiation of HGGs and lymphoma with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 76% for the optimal cut-off value of 0.82 × 10ˉ3 mm2/s.\n\nConclusion: The mean ADCt ratio allowed reliable differentiation of LGG and high grade brain tumors, including HGGs, metastases, and lymphoma.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Glioma is the most prevalent malignant form of brain tumors, with a dismal prognosis. Currently, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment for patients with advanced highly aggressive therapyresistant tumors. However, there is no effective biomarker to reflect the response to immunotherapy in glioma patient so far. So we aim to assess the clinical predictive value of FCER1G in patients with glioma.\n\nMethods: The expression level and correlation between clinical prognosis and FER1G levels were analyzed with the data from CGGA, TCGA, and GEO database. Univariate and multivariate cox regression model was built to predict the prognosis of glioma patients with multiple factors. Then the correlation between FCER1G with immune cell infiltration and activation was analyzed. At last, we predict the immunotherapeutic response in both high and low FCER1G expression subgroups.\n\nResults: FCER1G was significantly higher in glioma with greater malignancy and predicted poor prognosis. In multivariate analysis, the hazard ratio of FCER1G expression (Low versus High) was 0.66 and 95 % CI is 0.54 to 0.79 (P < 0.001), whereas age (HR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.04-1.52), grade (HR = 2.75, 95 % CI 2.06-3.68), tumor recurrence (HR = 2.17, 95 % CI 1.81-2.62), IDH mutant (HR = 2.46, 95 % CI 1.97-3.01) and chemotherapeutic status (HR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.20-1.80) are also included. Furthermore, we illustrated that gene FCER1G stratified glioma cases into high and low FCER1G expression subgroups that demonstrated with distinct clinical outcomes and T cell activation. At last, we demonstrated that high FCER1G levels presented great immunotherapeutic response in glioma patients.\n\nConclusions: This study demonstrated FCER1G as a novel predictor for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and response to immunotherapy in glioma patient. Assess expression of FCER1G is a promising method to discover patients that may benefit from immunotherapy.",

A downstream marker of MAP-kinase pathway activation is cyclin D1. However, the expression of cyclin D1 has not been studied in the differential diagnosis between these brain tumors.\n\nThe aim of this work is to compare the expression of cyclin D1 in ganglioglioma, PXA, pilocytic astrocytoma. We also compared cyclin D1 expression in giant cell glioblastoma and in IDH wild type glioblastoma.\n\nOur work shows that roughly half of gangliogliomas have ganglion cells stained by cyclin D1 while two third of PXA have pleormophic cells stained by cyclin D1 and 15% of giant cell glioblastoma have pleomorphic cells stained by cyclin D1 (p < 0.001).

Cyclin D1 is expressed in most cases of BRAF V600E mutated gangliogliomas but also in cases without BRAF mutations suggesting an activation of MAP-kinase pathway through another way. Cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry has currently no or little role in the differential diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. Its role in the differential diag nosis between PXA and giant cell glioblastoma needs to be further investigated on external series.",

In this study, we evaluated the practicality of using EDB-FN as a biomarker and therapeutic target for malignant gliomas (MGs), representative intractable diseases involving brain tumors.\n\nMethods: The microarray- and sequence-based patient transcriptomic database 'Oncopression' and tissue microarray of MG patient tissue samples were analyzed. EDB-FN data were extracted and evaluated from 23,344 patient samples of 17 types of cancer to assess its effectiveness and selectivity as a molecular target. To strengthen the results of the patient data analysis, the utility of EDB-FN as a molecular marker and target for MG was verified using active EDB-FN-targeting ultrasmall lipidic micellar nanoparticles (~12 nm), which had a high drug-loading capacity and were efficiently internalized by MG cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\nResults: Brain tumors had a 1.42-fold cancer-to-normal ratio (p < 0.0001), the second highest among 17 cancers after head and neck cancer. Patient tissue microarray analysis showed that the EDB-FN high-expression group had a 5.5-fold higher risk of progression than the EDB-FN low-expression group (p < 0.03). By labeling docetaxel-containing ultrasmall micelles with a bipodal aptide targeting EDB-FN (termed APT EDB -DSPE-DTX), we generated micelles that could specifically bind to MG cells, leading to superior antitumor efficacy of EDB-FN-targeting nanoparticles compared to nontargeting controls. Conclusions: Taken together, these results show that EDB-FN can be an effective drug delivery target and biomarker for MG.",

    "abstract": "Objective Gliomas are the most common intracranial tumors. Histopathology and neuroimaging are the main modalities used for diagnosis and treatment response monitoring. However, both are expensive and insensitive methods and can cause neurological deterioration. This study aimed to develop a minimally invasive peripheral inflammatory biomarker for diagnosis of glioma, its grade, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status.\n\nMaterials and Methods Patients undergoing surgery for glioma, acoustic neuroma, and meningioma between January 2019 and December 2019 were included. Preoperative neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), eosinophil/lymphocyte ratio (ELR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were calculated. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were done postoperatively.\n\nResults A total of 154 patients of glioma, 36 patients of acoustic neuroma, 58 patients of meningioma, and 107 healthy controls were included. dNLR showed the maximum area under the curve (AUC) (0.656639) for diagnosis of glioma from other tumors and among combinations. dNLR +NLR showed the maximum AUC (0.647865). Maximum AUC for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) versus other grades and among combinations was shown by NLR (0.83926). NLR + dNLR had the maximum AUC (0.764794). NLR showed significant p value in differentiating IDH wild from IDH mutant GBM.\n\nConclusion dNLR has the maximum diagnostic value in diagnosing glioma from other tumors. NLR (AUC = 0.83926) showed the highest accuracy for GBM diagnosis and may be a parameter in predicting the grade of glioma; also, it has maximum diagnostic value in differentiating IDH wild GBM from IDH mutant GBM. These peripheral inflammatory parameters may prove to be sensitive and cost-effective markers for glioma diagnosis, predicting grade of glioma, monitoring of treatment response, and in predicting recurrence.",

Treatment options are limited, clinicians lack efﬁcient prognostic and predictive markers. Circulating miRNAs—besides being important regulators of cancer development—may have potential as diagnostic biomarkers of GBM. (2) Methods: In this study, proﬁling of 798 human miRNAs was performed on blood plasma samples from 6 healthy individuals and 6 patients with GBM, using a NanoString nCounter Analysis System. To validate our results, ﬁve miRNAs (hsamiR-433-3p, hsa-miR-362-3p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-133a-3p, and hsa-miR-29a-3p) were randomly chosen for RT-qPCR detection. (3) Results: In all, 53 miRNAs were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in plasma samples of GBM patients when data were ﬁltered for FC 1 and FDR 0.1. Target genes of the top 39 differentially expressed miRNAs were identiﬁed, and we carried out functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis of target genes via GO and KEGG-based tools. General and cortex-speciﬁc protein-protein interaction networks were constructed from the target genes of top miRNAs to assess their functional connections.

Methods: This retrospective immunohistochemical study included 42 glioblastoma cases, 21 oligodendrogliomas, 15 ependymomas, 15 pilocytic astrocytomas, 5 sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytoma and 4 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas. Results: Most glioblastoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (71%), sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytoma (80%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (75%) cases showed strong SRSF1 immunoexpression, while no detectable staining was found in the majority of ependymomas (87% of cases) and pilocytic astrocytomas (67% of cases). Conclusions: The immunohistochemical expression of SRSF1 may be a promising diagnostic marker of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and its increased expression might allow for excluding entities that often enter into differential diagnosis, such as ependymomas and pilocytic astrocytomas.",

    "abstract": "GBM (Glioblastoma multiform) is the most malignant tumor type of the central nervous system and has poor diagnostic and clinical outcomes. LncRNAs (Long non-coding RNAs) have been reported to participate in multiple biological and pathological processes, but their underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to explore the role of the lncRNA HAS2-AS1 (HAS2 antisense RNA 1) in GBM. GSE103227 was analyzed, and qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of HAS2-AS1 in GBM. FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) was performed to verify the localization of HAS2-AS1. The interaction between HAS2-AS1 and miR-137 (microRNA-137) was predicted by LncBook and miRcode followed by dual‐luciferase reporter assays, and the relationships among HAS2-AS1, miR-137 and LSD1 (lysine-speciﬁc demethylase 1) were assessed by WB (western blot) and qRT-PCR. Colony formation and CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assays were performed as functional tests. In vivo, nude mice were used to conﬁrm the function of HAS2-AS1. HAS2-AS1 expression was upregulated in GBM cell lines, and HAS2-AS1 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm. In vitro, high HAS2-AS1 expression promoted proliferation, and knockdown of HAS2-AS1 signiﬁcantly inhibited proliferation. Furthermore, HAS2-AS1 functioned as a ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) of miR-137, leading to the disinhibition of its downstream target LSD1. The miR-137 level was downregulated by HAS2-AS1 overexpression and upregulated by HAS2-AS1 knockdown. In a subsequent study, LSD1 expression was negatively regulated by miR137, while miR-137 reversed the LSD1 expression levels caused by HAS2-AS1. These results were further supported by the nude mouse tumorigenesis experiment; compared with xenografts with high HAS2-AS1 expression, the group with low levels of HAS2-AS1 exhibited suppressed proliferation and better survival. We conclude that lncRNA HAS2AS1 promotes proliferation by functioning as a miR‐137 decoy to increase LSD1 levels and thus might be a possible biomarker for GBM.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of SUMO1P3 on glioma progression. The results demonstrated that SUMO1P3 expression was upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, SUMO1P3 was associated with a poor overall survival of patients with glioma. The results of the in vitro cell proliferation and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that SUMO1P3-knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle. The results of the wound healing and Transwell assays demonstrated that SUMO1P3-knockdown significantly repressed cell migration and invasion. In addition, SUMO1P3 promoted glioma by regulating the expression levels of β-catenin, cyclin-D1, N-cadherin and E-cadherin.

    "abstract": "Background: Although many biomarkers have been reported for detecting glioma, the prognosis for the disease remains poor, and therefore, new biomarkers need to be identified. GNG5, which is part of the G-protein family, has been associated with different malignant tumors, though the role of GNG5 in glioma has not been studied. Therefore, we aimed to identify the relationship between GNG5 and glioma prognosis and identify a new biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of gliomas.\n\nMethods: We used data on more than a thousand gliomas from multiple databases and clinical data to determine the expression of GNG5 in glioma. Based on clinical data and CGGA database, we identified the correlation between GNG5 and multiple molecular and clinical features and prognosis using various analytical methods. Co-expression analysis and GSEA were performed to detect GNG5-related genes in glioma and possible signaling pathways involved. ESTIMATE, ssGSEA, and TIMER were used to detect the relationship between GNG5 and the immune microenvironment. Functional experiments were performed to explore the function of GNG5 in glioma cells.\n\nResults: GNG5 is highly expressed in gliomas, and its expression level is positively correlated with pathological grade, histological type, age, and tumor recurrence and negatively correlated with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, 1p/19 co-deletion, and chemotherapy. Moreover, GNG5 as an independent risk factor was negatively correlated with the overall survival time. GSEA revealed the potential signaling pathways involved in GNG5 function in gliomas, including cell adhesion molecules signaling pathway. The ssGSEA, ESTIMATE, and TIMER based analysis indicated a correlation between GNG5 expression and various immune cells in glioma. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that GNG5 could participate in glioma cell proliferation and migration.\n\nConclusions: Based on the large data platform and the use of different databases to corroborate results obtained using various datasets, as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments, our study reveals for the first time that GNG5, as an oncogene, is overexpressed in gliomas and can inhibit the proliferation and migration of glioma cells and lead to poor prognosis of patients. Thus, GNG5 is a potential novel biomarker for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of gliomas.",

Glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2), as a factor in oxidative stress, plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, its role in GBM has not been well established. The study aimed to investigate the clinical signiﬁcance of GPX2 with GBM prognosis.\n\nMethods ‒ Data of GBM and healthy individuals were retrospectively collected from oncomine, cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), gene expression proﬁling interactive analysis (GEPIA), UALCAN, and Human Protein Atlas. GPX2 mRNA expression was ﬁrst assessed across various cancer types in oncomine and cancer cell lines from CCLE. The mRNA expression of GPX2 was compared between normal and GBM tissues using GEPIA (normal = 207; GBM = 163) and UALCAN (normal = 5; GBM = 156). The GPX2 methylation was analyzed using data from UALCAN (normal = 2; GBM = 140). The prognostic value of GPX2 in GBM was explored in GEPIA and UALCAN using KaplanMeier method. STRING database was used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Statistical signiﬁcance was set as <0.05.\n\nResults ‒ The current study revealed no signiﬁcant differences in GPX2 expression between normal and GBM from GEPIA data (P > 0.05) and UALCAN (P = 0.257). Patients with higher GPX2 intended to have a poorer prognosis (P = 0.0089). The KEGG pathways found that chemokine-signaling pathway were the more preferred.\n\nConclusions ‒ The ﬁndings demonstrated that GPX2 might be a potential diagnosis and prognostic indicator for GBM.

Hitherto, it is unknown about the role of exosomal hsa_circ_0072083 (circ_0072083) in TMZ resistance in glioma, and whether it is associated with NANOG via regulating miRNA sponge and methylation.\n\nMethods: TMZ-resistant (n = 36) and sensitive (n = 33) patients were recruited. The sensitive cells and constructed resistant cells were cultured and exposed to TMZ. circ_0072083, miR-1252-5p, AlkB homolog H5 (ALKBH5) and NANOG levels were examined via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of TMZ, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed via Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays. The in vivo function was assessed using xenograft model. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) level was analyzed via methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP). Target relationship was investigated via dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Warburg effect was investigated via lactate production, glucose uptake and key enzymes expression. Exosome was isolated and confirmed via transmission electron microscopy and specific protein expression. \n\nResults: circ_0072083 expression was increased in TMZ-resistant glioma tissues and cells. circ_0072083 knockdown restrained the resistance of resistant cells via decreasing IC50 of TMZ, proliferation, migration, invasion and xenograft tumor growth and increasing apoptosis. circ_0072083 silence reduced NANOG expression via blocking ALKBH5mediated demethylation. circ_0072083 could regulate NANOG and ALKBH5 via targeting miR-1252-5p to control TMZ resistance.

By analyzing the TCGA dataset, we observed the upregulation of SLC16A1-AS1 expression in GBM. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of SLC16A1-AS1 in this cancer.\n\nMethods: GBM tissues and paired non-tumor tissues were collected from 62 GBM patients through biopsy. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of SLC16A1-AS1 and miR-149. Linear regression was used to analyze their correlations. The relationship between SLC16A1-AS1 and miR-149 was assessed by gain and loss of function experiments. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were performed to analyze the methylation status of miR-149. Cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assay and colony formation experiments in GBM cells.\n\nResults: We found that SLC16A1-AS1 expression was upregulated in GBM tissues, and the upregulated expression of SLC16A1-AS1 predicted poor survival of GBM patients. MiR-149 was downregulated in GBM tissues and inversely correlated with the expression of SLC16A1-AS1. In GBM cells, overexpression of SLC16A1-AS1 downregulated the expres sion of miR-149 and increased the methylation of miR-149 gene. In cell proliferation and colony formation assay, overexpression of SLC16A1-AS1 reduced the inhibitory effects of miR-149 on GBM cell proliferation.\n\n­\n\nConclusion: SLC16A1-AS1 may promote GBM cell proliferation by regulating miR-149 methylation.

    "abstract": "Notch intracellular domain (NICD), also known as the activated form of Notch1 is closely associated with cell differentiation and tumor invasion. However, the role of NICD in glioblastoma (GBM) proliferation and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of NICD and Notch1 downstream gene HES5 in human GBM and normal brain samples and to further detect the effect of NICD on human GBM cell proliferation. For this purpose, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed to analyze the expression of NICD in human GBM tissues, while western blotting and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR experiments were used to analyze the expression of Hes5 in human GBM tissues. A Flag-NICD vector was used to overexpress NICD in U87 cells and compound E and small interfering (si) Notch1 were used to downregulate NICD. Cellular proliferation curves were generated and BrdU assays performed to evaluate the proliferation of U87 cells. The results demonstrated that compared with normal brain tissues, the level of NICD protein in human GBM tissues was upregulated and the protein and mRNA levels of Hes5 were also upregulated in GBM tissues indicating that the Notch1 signaling pathway is activated in GBM. Overexpression of NICD promoted the proliferation of U87 cells in vitro while downregulation of NICD by treatment with compound E or siNotch1 suppressed the proliferation of U87 cells in vitro. In conclusion, NICD was upregulated in human GBM and NICD promoted GBM proliferation via the Notch1 signaling pathway. NICD may be a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for GBM treatment.",

    "abstract": "The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes, neural stem cells, and in gliomas. Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors that arise from glia cells or neural stem cells and rely on accurate diagnosis for prognosis and treatment strategies. GFAP is differentially expressed between glioma subtypes and, therefore, often used as a diagnostic marker. However, GFAP is highly regulated by the process of alternative splicing; many different isoforms have been identified. Differential expression of GFAP isoforms between glioma subtypes suggests that GFAP isoform-specific analyses could benefit diagnostics. In this study we report on the differential expression of a new GFAP isoform between glioma subtypes, GFAPµ. A short GFAP transcript resulting from GFAP exon 2 skipping was detected by RNA sequencing of human glioma. We show that GFAPµ mRNA is expressed in healthy brain tissue, glioma cell lines, and primary glioma cells and that it translates into a ~21 kDa GFAP protein. 21 kDa GFAP protein was detected in the IF protein fraction isolated from human spinal cord as well. We further show that induced GFAPµ expression disrupts the GFAP IF network. The characterization of this new GFAP isoform adds on to the numerous previously identified GFAP splice isoforms. It emphasizes the importance of studying the contribution of IF splice variants to specialized functions of the IF network and to glioma research.",

    "abstract": "Background: XRCC2, a homologous recombination-related gene, has been reported to be associated with a variety of cancers. However, its role in glioma has not been reported. This study aimed to find out the role of XRCC2 in glioma and reveal in which glioma-specific biological processes is XRCC2 involved based on thousands of glioma samples, thereby, providing a new perspective in the treatment and prognostic evaluation of glioma.\n\nMethods: The expression characteristics of XRCC2 in thousands of glioma samples from CGGA and TCGA databases were comprehensively analyzed. Wilcox or Kruskal test was used to analyze the expression pattern of XRCC2 in gliomas with different clinical and molecular features. The effect of XRCC2 on the prognosis of glioma patients was explored by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed the possible cellular mechanisms involved in XRCC2 in glioma. Connectivity map (CMap) was used to screen small molecule drugs targeting XRCC2 and the expression levels of XRCC2 were verified in glioma cells and tissues by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical staining.\n\nResults: We found the overexpression of XRCC2 in glioma. Moreover, the overexpressed XRCC2 was associated with a variety of clinical features related to prognosis. Cox and meta-analyses showed that XRCC2 is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of glioma. Furthermore, the results of GSEA indicated that overexpressed XRCC2 could promote malignant progression through involved signaling pathways, such as in the cell cycle. Finally, doxazosin, quinostatin, canavanine, and chrysin were identified to exert anti-glioma effects by targeting XRCC2.\n\nConclusions: This study analyzed the expression pattern of XRCC2 in gliomas and its relationship with prognosis using multiple datasets. This is the first study to show that XRCC2, a novel oncogene, is significantly overexpressed in glioma and can lead to poor prognosis in glioma patients. XRCC2 could serve as a new biomarker for glioma diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis evaluation, thus bringing new insight into the management of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance and disease recurrence are i tant contributors for the poor prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy for GBM treatment, can methylate DNA and cause the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs). X-ray repair cross complementing 5 (XRCC5), also known as Ku80 or Ku86, is required for the repair of DSBs. The present study identified novel determinants that sensitize cells to TMZ, using an array-based short hairpin (sh)RNA library. Then, cBioportal, Oncomine, and R2 databases were used to analyze the association between gene expression levels and clinical characteristics. Subsequently, lentiviral shRNA or pCMV was used to knockdown or overexpress the gene of interest, and the effects on TMZ sensitivity were determined using a MTT assay and western blot analysis. TMZ-resistant cells were also established and were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the role of the gene of interest in TMZ resistance. The results indicated that XRCC5 was effective in enhancing TMZ cytotoxicity. The results from the bioinformatics analysis revealed that XRCC5 mRNA expression levels were associated with clinical deterioration and lower overall survival rates. In addition, XRCC5 knockdown could significantly increase TMZ sensitivity in GBM cells, while XRCC5 overexpression caused the cancer cells to be resistant to TMZ. Both the in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that TMZ treatment could induce expression of XRCC5 in TMZ-resistant cells. Taken together these ﬁndings suggested that XRCC5 could be a promising target for GBM treatment and could also be used as a diagnostic marker for refractory GBM.",

A conventional MRI protocol was extended with a physiological MRI approach including vascular architecture mapping and quantitative blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging which required 7 min extra data acquisition time. Custom-made MATLAB software was used for the calculation of MRI biomarker maps of microvascular perfusion and architecture, neovascularization activity, tissue oxygen metabolism, and tension. Statistical procedures included receiver operating characteristic analysis.\n\nResults Overall, 34 patients showed recurrence of the WHO grade 3 glioma; of these, in 15 patients, recurrence was detected one follow-up examination (averaged 160 days) earlier by physiological MRI data than by conventional MRI. During this time period, the tumor volume increased significantly (P = 0.001) on average 7.4-fold from 1.5 to 11.1 cm 3 . Quantitative analysis of MRI biomarkers demonstrated microvascular but no macrovascular hyperperfusion in early recurrence. Neovascularization activity (AUC = 0.833), microvascular perfusion (0.682), and oxygen metabolism (0.661) showed higher diagnostic performance for early recurrence detection of WHO grade 3 glioma compared to conventional MRI including cerebral blood volume (0.649).\n\nConclusion This study demonstrated that the targeted assessment of microvascular features and tissue oxygen tension as an early sign of neovascularization activity provided valuable information for recurrence diagnostic of WHO grade 3 glioma.",

Glioma stem cells (GSCs) may be an important factor in glioma cell proliferation, invasion, chemoradiotherapy tolerance, and recurrence. Therefore, discovering novel GSCs related circular RNAs (circRNAs) may ﬁnds out a prospective target for the treatment of glioma. A novel circRNACHAF1A (circCHAF1A) was ﬁrst found in our study. CircCHAF1A was overexpressed in glioma and related to the low survival rate. Functionally, it was found that no matter in vitro or in vivo, circCHAF1A can facilitate the proliferation and tumorigenesis of TP53wt GSCs. Mechanistically, circCHAF1A upregulated transcription factor HOXC8 expression in GSCs through miR-211-5p sponging. Then, HOXC8 can transcriptionally upregulate MDM2 expression and inhibited the antitumor effect of p53. Furtherly, the RNA binding protein FMR1 can bind to and promoted the expression of circCHAF1A via maintaining its stability, while HOXC8 also transcribed the FMR1 expression to form a feedback loop, which may be involved in the malignant transformation of glioma. The novel feedback loop among FMR1, circCHAF1A, miR-211-5p, and HOXC8 in GSCs can facilitate the proliferation and tumorigenesis of glioma and GSCs.
